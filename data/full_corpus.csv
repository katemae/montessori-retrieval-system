excerpt_3,"Along with academic skills and knowledge, children in Montessori learn to control their movements to an end, to make choices, to get along with others, to work as part of a community, to concentrate, and so on. Those skills are as relevant for boys as they are for girls. In fact, given the higher prevalence of attention and reading problems in boys generally, Montessori, with its special work on attention and on phonemic analysis at early ages, might be especially beneficial to boys. One of the two major Head Start studies using random assignment showed Montessori particularly benefits boys (Miller & Bizzell, 1984)",Montessori,Cognitive,Example/Study,excerpt,Education for Children,excerpt_dataset,

For example, children with dyslexia might especially benefit from the phonic approach taken to reading, and children with attention deficit disorders might benefit particularly from the emphasis on focused concentration and routines. The origins of the method lie in the extraordinary successes of retarded children using early versions of the Sensorial Materials. However, this does not mean Montessori is mainly for children with learning disorders.

Half of the subjects were told they could terminate the noise at anytime with a switch, but they were discouraged from doing so and few people actually used the switch, whereas others were simply subjected to the loud noise, with no suggestion that they could control it. Even though they had not opted to control the noise, those who believed themselves able to control it noticed significantly more errors on the proofreading task and were significantly more persistent in their attempts to solve the tangram puzzles.

excerpt_11,"Another study reported similar effects in adults for solving anagrams, in which letters are unscrambled to make words. In this case the anagrams were patterned, so the rearrangement of letters was the same (by placement) for each anagram (Hiroto & Seligman, 1975). One might learn to detect this arrangement in the first few anagrams and thus solve later ones very quickly. The manipulation of interest was a pretreatment of uncontrollable noise, as opposed to controllable noise. After a period in which they heard noise which they believed they could escape, participants were subsequently significantly more likely to discover the pattern in the anagrams. When participants thought the noise was inescapable, they were much less likely to subsequently discover the pattern. Later learning was thus influenced by a prior provision of choice.",Montessori,Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Choice and Perceived Control,excerpt_dataset,

A second group was told the experimenter had chosen their categories, and a third was told their mothers had made the choice. Categories were in fact yoked, so all the children had the free choice group’s anagrams. There were two significant findings of interest here. First, the children who had chosen their own category solved twice as many anagrams as children who thought their mothers or the experimenter had chosen their category. Second, during an optional free-play period after the initial anagram task, the children who had chosen their own category spent much more time freely choosing to solve anagrams than did children whose category had been chosen for them.",Montessori,Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Choice and Perceived Control,excerpt_dataset,

Children in the choice group were told they could do whatever they liked, but it was strongly suggested that they start with the drawing game. Children in the no-choice group were told that the experimenter used to let children choose, but not any more, and that they should start with the drawing game. Whereas 80% of the children in the choice condition chose the drawing activity first, only 20% of the children in the control group did so.

One issue that arises is whether the type of engagement children have with computers (and television) is of the right sort for helping development. If learning to regulate one’s attention is important to development, and the research discussed at the end of chapter 3 implies it very much is, then materials that use bells and whistles above and beyond what one normally encounters in life might do them a disservice. Television and computer programs frequently regulate children’s attention for them because they are multisensory and fast paced and present sequences of images that are not possible in the real world. Successful attention-training programs are frequently done with computer programs, but these programs are often simpler than the programs used to attract children’s attention (e.g., Klingberg et al., 2002).",Traditional,Academic,Example,excerpt,Interest in Human Learning,excerpt_dataset,

The research suggests this combination may be most optimal. When the routines are not specified, children might well not learn much yet when the day’s schedule is set, children’s sense of control is compromised.

Likewise, when the child builds the Pink Tower, described in chapter 2, if the child skips a block in the sequence, later the child will be confronted with a block that is larger than the one under it. A child can easily spot such an error. For many Montessori materials, then, corrective feedback from the teacher is unnecessary; a child can clearly see if he or she made an error due to incorporation of control of error in the Montessori materials.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_120,"Another way error is controlled by the materials is through the use of a standard material against which children can compare their own work, allowing them to find their own errors. When children are doing geography, for example, they use large (about 18"" x 30"") Wooden Maps (see Figure 5.1). The countries are painted different colors, and each has a knob allowing it to be easily lifted out. As mentioned in chapter 2, after initial work simply putting the ""puzzle"" together (which in itself is self-correcting), the child traces each country onto another sheet of paper, recreating the map",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,

However, even if some reverse directions of effect are sometimes partly responsible for findings, it is likely that parent-to-child effects also occur. This is suggested by the fact that adult imposition of structure improves the outcomes of children with ADHD (MTA Cooperative Group, 1999) and that when parents enact bedtime routines, children’s sleep patterns improve (Seymour, Brock, During, & Poole, 1989).",Traditional,Environment,Study,excerpt,Order in Environment and Mind,excerpt_dataset,

The disrupted routines themselves might have no direct effect on child functioning. Another potential third variable is family income. Several studies have noted that a feature of low-income children’s homes is the lack of order (Klaus & Gray, 1968; Pavenstedt, 1965), and low-income families are also often less educated and bear other features that could independently lead to poorer child outcomes.",Traditional,Environment,Study,excerpt,Order in Environment and Mind,excerpt_dataset,

To examine the transfer to reading, she made cards with the names of different toys on them, and brought a basket of the toys to the children, to use as rewards. If children could read the name on a card, she promised, they could play with the toy as a reward. Like many adults, she assumed rewards were positive and even necessary to get children to engage in difficult tasks. The children, however, showed her differently. They eagerly read the words, but showed no interest in the toys, asking instead for another word to read. This suggested to her that a challenging activity, reading (for new readers), could be motivating in and of itself. The extrinsic reward of playing with a toy was not valued, and in fact seemed an undesired distraction from their real mission.

The teacher assists the child’s learning by showing the child how widely one has to stretch one’s arms to hold the longest one versus a shorter one, how the rods differ in weight, and so on. With the help of their bodies, children learn to perceive the differences in the Red Rods and to line them up from shortest to longest.

The structural organization involved was a diorama of a miniature town, into which 20 small items, including animals, cars, people, and so on, were logically placed while the children, Maya and American 8- and 9-year-olds, looked on. The 20 objects were then replaced into the pool of 80 items from which they were drawn, and the children were asked to reconstruct the scene. Although the Maya sample had shown much poorer memory previously on a standard list task, their performance was even slightly better than that of the American children in this organized task. Although children learn to memorize lists of unrelated items in Traditional schools, one might question whether this is a good use of their processing resources.Transitive inference tasks are ones in which one learns that A > B and B > C, and one must infer that A > C.

When the child did not see the object under the first pillow, the child gave up. Piaget then showed the child how he had moved the object, and repeated the procedure. The child behaved in exactly the same way, whereupon Piaget lifted the second pillow and asked, ""Didn’t you see I put it here?"" (on the prior hiding trial). ""Yes,"" his child replied, ""but it should be there"" (pointing to the first pillow) (Montessori, 1966, pp. 53–54). Although to Piaget this task was probably about inference, to Dr. Montessori the incident was about the child’s need to find the object in its proper place. She also noted that children often play hide-and-seek by hiding in the same place over and over, or in the place where the last hider was just found. She saw this as also reflecting a need for order, for there being set places and times for objects and events.

Bandura showed children films of an adult hitting a wobbly blow-up “Bobo” doll and noted that children were later apt to behave toward the doll as the adult had. According to behaviorists, such learning should not have occurred, because children were not rewarded directly for the behaviors they later enacted. The studies made the point that learning can occur by simply watching what others do, irrespective of personal rewards. Along with other important developments at the time, Bandura’s work helped to turn the dominant paradigm of American psychology from behaviorism to cognitive science",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_160,"Dr. Montessori described an early case in which it became apparent to her that children’s tendency to imitate others can be a useful source of inlearning from peers 197 spiration in school, advancing children to new abilities. This observation, called the “explosion” into writing, recurs annually in well-functioning Montessori Primary classrooms when the first 4-year-old suddenly realizes, after months of working with the preparatory materials, that he or she can write. “The first word to be written by one of them brought a great outburst of joy and laughter. Everyone looked admiringly at ‘the writer,’ and thus they felt moved to follow his example. ‘I can do it too!’ they cried. The achievement of one started off the whole group” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 231). Other 4-year-olds, having also been indirectly prepared to write through the use of knobs on Wooden Cylinders and other materials, pencils in Metal Insets, and so on, as was described in chapter 1, spontaneously began writing in reaction to having observed a first child reaching that landmark. Obviously children also see others learn to write in traditional schools; what is unique in Montessori is the series of steps, all visible and imitable, that lead children along the path to writing, so that a community of 4-year-olds can discover they already have the ability to write once they see it done by another child.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_163,"One might wonder how learning by observation in a Montessori classroom is possible for the oldest children, who are working at the highest levels with many of the available materials.

excerpt_166,"One study of the efficacy of such a system (“Classwide Peer Tutoring”) involved first- and second-grade classrooms in low-income schools (Greenwood et al., 1987). Classrooms were randomly assigned to tutoring and control conditions for spelling. In control classrooms, teachers used standard methods of teaching spelling: a workbook with word lists and vocabulary exercises, chalkboard, self-study, and homework assignments. In classrooms that used the tutoring program, the tutoring process described earlier replaced some in-class spelling work. Over the two years of the study, children in the peer tutoring classrooms were spelling 87% of the words correctly on average, whereas children in other classrooms were spelling 75% of words correctly. This is not an enormous difference, but it is certainly a meaningful one. Peering tutoring programs also appear to confer many social benefits on the classroom (Fantuzzo, Riggio, Connelly, & Dimeff, 1989; Maheady & Sainato, 1985). In addition, they apparently benefit learning other topics and over the long term",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_167,"In one demonstration of these benefits, a follow-up study expanded the peer tutoring to cover reading, math, and language, and examined children’s performance over multiple years. Children in the tutoring program performed significantly better than those in the control group on all three topics both immediately and two years later, when they had moved on to middle school and no longer had the program. They also performed better in two nontutored topics: science and social studies. They even performed as well as children in a higher SES group in all these areas (Greenwood et al., 1989). In addition, fewer children from the peer tutoring group were placed in special-education classes (Greenwood, Terry, Utley, Montagna, & Walker, 1993). This study is among many suggesting that peer tutoring programs, appropriately structured, improve learning in traditional schools and that the benefits extend across time and topics (see Topping & Ehly, 1998).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_168,"Peer tutoring programs vary in terms of how structured each tutoring session is, and more structured programs are typically associated with greater success. Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) is an example of a more structured tutoring program (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998), and it has also been used to examine the effect of rewards. RPT begins with training sessions about teamwork and cooperation, and children are told they can win rewards by using teamwork. In the RPT program, teaching aides show the children how to tutor each other. Then RPT sessions are held twice weekly for 45 minutes each. Special flash-card materials are used, with a problem on one side and steps to the solution on the other. Children decide who will be tutor first in each session, and work for 10 minutes on problems before switching roles. After the initial 20 minutes, problem drill sheets are administered, and students attempt the problems, then switch papers with partners for correction. Performance on the drill sheets accrues points, which lead to such rewards as being teacher’s helper or working on a special project. When children were randomly assigned to RPT versus traditional instruction groups, those in the RPT groups consistently showed higher levels of mathematics achievement (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998). Two alternative groups were also formed, one with the reward but lacking the structure provided by the flash cards, and the other having the structure but no reward. The combination of rewards and structure led to the most gains in both achievement and positive social behavior. Structure alone, without rewards, was associated with better behavior both in the tutoring sessions and in the regular classroom situation. Students also perceived themselves to be more competent when using structured than when using unstructured tutoring, but achievement was not improved in the absence of rewards (Fantuzzo, King, & Heller, 1992). Thus, within a traditional school environment, more structured peer interactions with a reward structure optimized learning and behavior. The issue of rewards is important and is discussed further in the context of collaborative learning.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_169,"Although supplementing whole-class teaching with peer tutoring improves achievement, adults are even more effective tutors than peers. The research suggests several reasons for this that shed light on how peer tutoring can be most effective. First, adults structure the task in ways that keep the overarching goal in clear focus, whereas child partners tend to focus on parts of the problem, losing sight of the whole--a difference reminiscent of the differences between same-age experts and novices. For example, if the task is planning a route for doing a set of errands as efficiently as possible, child pairs will get the errands done, but not as efficiently, because they focus on each individual item to be retrieved separately, rather than thinking about how several items can be grouped to make for more efficient routes. Adult tutors get children to think about grouping items. However, when the peer tutor is trained in this task and taught to consider how to group items, tutee performance does improve. Nonetheless, performance even with a trained peer tutor does not improve to the level obtained when the tutor was an adult (Gauvain, 2001).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_170,"A second probable reason for the greater success of adult tutors is that adults tend to include children more in the task at hand. Other children can become autocratic, as children are inclined to focus on who gets to do what. Children tend to like to do; adults more easily sit back, watch, and guide. Research has shown that peer learning is also more successful when peers listen to each other and question each other more (reviewed below), skills that many adults have but many children have not yet learned (Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_171,"Perhaps in part because peer tutors can become autocratic, some research suggests that, when tutored by a peer, the tutee benefits maximally from a peer who is just a bit more advanced rather than much more advanced. For example, research on both scientific and moral reasoning has shown that children benefit from exposure to thought processes that are just above their current level (Damon & Killen, 1982; Kuhn, 1972; Turiel & Rothman, 1972)",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_172,"Besides being less able to adapt to a lower level of tutee, much older and more advanced peer tutors sometimes practice social dominance. The problems of autocracy mentioned earlier thus become exacerbated, and the tutee learns less, because he or she is less involved in the decision-making process. This was found in a study in which 5-year-old novices were paired either with 5- or 7-year-olds who were considered experts at planning routes (as in the study just described) (Duran & Gauvain, 1993). Children were more involved with the task when paired with an advanced planner of their own age, as opposed to an older planner, and this increased involvement predicted better performance. Whether the particular age gap used in this experiment (5 to 7) is a particularly problematic one would be an interesting topic for research. The age of 6 is a pivotal one, recognized in many of the world’s cultures as an appropriate time to ask more of children, such as by beginning formal schooling (Rogoff, 1981). Six is the age at which Piaget speculated children advance to being able to perform mental operations (for example, imagining addition and subtraction), and which Dr. Montessori considered transitional between her first and second planes of development. At each plane, she said, children think differently. Examining whether 6- and 8-, or 7- and 9-year-olds, make more effective tutoring pairs would be of interest.

After hearing the first story, children who did not solve it spontaneously (about 80% of them) were shown the solution.

He reasoned that close student contact, for the purpose of helping others, might alleviate problems, and so created learning arrangements that would lead to such contact. In the Jigsaw model, children are placed in groups of five or six and topics of study are broken into as many segments. For the topic of the Civil War, for example, one person might be assigned to study the history of slavery, another the type of weapons used in the era, another the major battles, 210 Montessori and so on. Children research their topic on their own, and then temporarily join a new group composed of the child from every other group in the class who was assigned their same topic. These “homogenous” groups share information and practice presentations of their topics. Finally, children reunite with their original groups, and each child teaches the material. A test on all the material generally follows. The Jigsaw method has repeatedly been found to improve learning as well as classroom social relations (Aronson, 2002; Bridgeman, 1981; Lazarowitz, Hertz-Lazarowitz, & Baird, 1994). In terms of academic achievement, it is particularly successful with minority youths, but in some cases it has improved, and in no cases (to my knowledge) has it negatively affected, the learning of other students (Lucker, Rosenfield, Sikes, & Aronson, 1977; Slavin, 1983).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

Children who worked together and were encouraged to talk were most likely to solve the puzzles and produced the most interpretive talk. Even when children were alone and encouraged to talk to themselves, their use of interpretive talk was positively related to their ability to solve the puzzles. Descriptive talk, which is more characteristic of children in the kindergarten years, was associated with low levels of performance on the problem-solving tasks. The children who performed the worst were ones who worked alongside others but were discouraged from talking at all, which is the typical arrangement in traditional elementary schools. In contrast, children at these ages in Montessori schools tend to work together, and they frequently talk while they work.

All children read a passage, then were asked how much they enjoyed the passage, how difficult it was, and how pressured they felt. Then they were told they would read a second passage, with directions that varied by condition. Some children were told, ""After you are finished, I’m going to test you on it. I want to see how much you can remember. You should work as hard as you can, because I’ll be grading you on the test to see if you’re learning well enough."" Another group of children was told, ""After you are finished, I’ll be asking you some questions similar to the ones I just asked about the other passage."" Recall that these questions were about their personal reactions to the passages. After answering the questions about interest, pressure, and difficulty for the second reading, the children were asked to recall as much of the second 160 Montessori passage as they could. To test for conceptual learning, they were also asked to write an essay on the main point of the passage. To test long-term retention, a week later, children were asked to once again recall the second passage by rote and to write an essay describing the passage’s main point. The results were highly suggestive of what expectations about getting a grade do for learning. Students who thought they would be graded rendered the passage by rote best at the first test, but had also forgotten the most a week later, making their long-term retention equal to that of the children who thought they would be questioned only about their personal reactions. At second testing, the ""personal-reaction"" children retained almost all of the rote information reported at the first session. But rote learning is usually not what we really value, after all. Conceptual learning--drawing the main point from what we read--is much more important, and the results here are compelling. The essays of the students who did not expect a test or a grade showed significantly greater conceptual learning than did the essays of the children who did expect one. The upshot is that students who expect to be tested initially learn the facts better, by rote, but as soon as the test is over, they forget much of what they learned.

Correct solutions to the first 9 problems all involved a particular pattern of use of three jugs, but a correct solution to the 10th one involved just two jugs, so the 10th problem was a set breaker: it required that the participant break a response set to consider a problem in a new way. What was of interest was not whether problems were solved correctly, since that was expected, but instead how long it took to solve them, particularly the set breaker. Whereas participants in both groups took equally long on the initial 9 items, the set-breaking 10th problem took participants in the nonreward condition only about half as long to solve as the participants who were trying for the $1 bonus.

excerpt_213,"One interesting study examined the impact of grades on self theories, goals, and performance in sixth-graders using tasks with both fixed and open-ended solutions (Butler & Nisan, 1986). Some of the fixed-solution tests were word games, such as making as many words as possible from the letters of a long word and constructing new words using the first and last letters of a prior word. The open-ended tasks included a ""creative uses"" task in which one comes up with as many uses as possible for an object, and a ""circles"" task, in which one is given a page of nickel-sized circles to draw on, and the creativity of one’s drawings is rated. All children performed similarly on a pre-test composed of these tasks. Two days later, some of the children were surprised by the return of their test booklets with either verbal feedback specifying how they could have performed better (""You wrote many short words, but not many long ones"") or a score. All of the children then engaged in slightly different versions of the same tasks. A third session two hours later repeated the original tasks, and children answered questions regarding their motivation on the tasks and the sources of their performance. An important factor to remember for the results of these experiments is that they were conducted in the children’s school classroom, in a manner reminiscent of school assignments. By sixth grade, students have learned that what one does in school is important only when there is evaluative extrinsic rewards and motivation 167 feedback. Unfortunately, university students often appear to feel the same way, visibly going on vacation when told something will not be on the exam. In keeping with this, students who had not gotten their test booklets back before the second session (no feedback) did not perform as well as the others on the later tests. They probably did not see the assignment as important and did not put in effort. Consistent with other studies, the two different kinds of feedback led to differences in performance on the open-ended tasks (not on the fixedsolution ones). For example, students who received verbal feedback about how to do better thought of more uses for objects later than did students who had received grades. In addition, students who received comments reported higher levels of motivation on and more liking for the tasks than did those who received grades. What was new about this study was that grades and comments also had different impacts on what the students felt contributed to their performance: their theories of intelligence. Students who received comments attributed their performance to effort, interest, and skill, whereas students who received grades were more apt to attribute their performance to the reader’s mood: an external, uncontrollable variable. If one has an incremental theory, skill is something one can control. The reader’s mood, on the other hand, is outside one’s control. The literature on learned helplessness and issues discussed in chapter 3 arise. As was discussed there, entity theorists tend to feel helpless in the face of failure. Attributions of effort aligned with these different perceptions of what underlay their performance. Students in the grades group attributed their effort to a desire to avoid failure, whereas those who received comments attributed their effort to their interest in the task. The entity theorists’ performance goals are thus apparent in the group who received grades. Grades and other evaluations, then, undermine motivation perhaps in part because they tend to lead to performance goals instead of mastery ones.

For the abstract group, all of the instruction examples were presented with general referents (""solid, liquid"") without any meaningful background theme. For example, one item read, ""There are three objects. Each is cut in one-half. In all, how many pieces would there be?"" (p. 73). The concrete group received hypothetical but concrete referents, for example stating that Bill had three candy bars, each of which he cut in half. The third group had examples that were intended to be most interesting, because they were personalized to concern matters of subjective importance, such as one’s birthday, teachers and friends, hobbies, and so on. For example, their teacher (mentioned by name) presented them with three Mars bars (their favorite candy) on their birthday, and if they cut each candy bar in half, how many friends could they share with? As bookends to these lessons, children took pre- and post-tests of their understanding of fractions. The results were clear in supporting that children learn best when the material is of personal interest. On the post-test, the abstract group scored lowest (averaging 2 of 11 problems correct), the concrete next-lowest (3.5 of 11), and the personalized group had the highest score (6 of 11).

Perhaps stimulating interest even further, they were also asked to discuss those math problems with their classmates (see chapter 6). The results showed that these students advanced dramatically in math, from the 30th to the 70th percentile, during the year of the intervention. The same teacher had used traditional methods (assigning problems from books, and not having students discuss them) the previous year with a similar group, and had seen no such advancement.

When paged, they filled out a form specifying their thoughts and activities at that moment. Three years later, the students’ progress in their talent areas was assessed. It was found that children’s achievement across the three years was directly related to the level of interest and excitement they expressed when engaged in the activity at the first time point.

This might be because of the more positive affect (Gasper & Clore, 2002).

Nine- to 11-year-olds were taught a computer math game, strangely titled (in the real world), ‘How the West Was One + Three x Four’ (Seiler, 1989) ... Children in the control condition saw the game in an unembellished, rather banal format, with the title of ‘Math Game.’ For the other children, the game was presented within a spaceship fantasy context and either had the title ‘Space Quest’ and involved the child imagining she or he was piloting a spaceship to other planets to save Earth from an energy crisis, or else had the title ‘Treasure Hunt,’ and involved imagining he or she was the captain of a ship seeking buried treasure. Some children also had personalized games that began with the child’s name (‘Best of luck in your journey, Commander Christy’) and sent the child off on the journey with his or her own personal favorite foods. Children played these games three times at school over a two-week period, for 30 minutes each time. A week later they were tested on their knowledge of the use of parentheses in arithmetic expressions as well as their knowledge of arithmetic operations in a different context. Their enjoyment of the game, their own assessment of their performance, and their desired level of challenge in future games were also assessed. The results were quite clear. When interesting contexts had been provided, children showed better knowledge of how parentheses affect arithmetic operations and were better able to transfer that knowledge to non-computer contexts. Personalization augmented these effects. In addition, students’ motivation was clearly influenced by the manipulation. Students in the context conditions were much more likely to opt for the computer playing its best game, liked the game more, were more willing to stay after school to play the game, believed themselves to be better at the games, and indicated they would seek a more challenging game later.

In one study showing this, teachers were shown a set of vignettes such as the following: Jim is an average student who has been working at grade level… Teachers’ responses resulted in scores for the degree to which they promoted autonomy in the classroom. Autonomy scores were found to align significantly with their students’ judgments of the atmosphere in the classroom, suggesting good correspondence between how students see the teacher and what the teacher thinks is appropriate to do.

As was mentioned in chapter 5, people’s responses to challenges can be seen as fitting into two basic categories (Dweck, 1999). One is mastery oriented: people aim to overcome the challenges. Such people view mistakes as learning opportunities, and when they err, they continue to engage in the task with the aim of mastering it. The second is a helpless pattern, in which people back down from challenges, opting for easier tasks instead. They tend to view mistakes as reflections of some permanent defect of their character, and thus they seek to avoid tasks that will cast themselves in a negative light.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

The helpless pattern goes along with a theory of intelligence as a fixed entity, and the mastery pattern goes along with a theory of intelligence as malleable. Chapter 5 discussed studies indicating that grading appears to push people to adopt the performance goals that go with an entity theory of intelligence and choose activities that will indicate that they are highly intelligent. By contrast, mastery-oriented responses promote choosing of tasks that help one learn, which inspire one to master challenging tasks (Dweck, 1999).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_234,"Dweck and her colleagues have shown that by implicitly endorsing one or the other theory, adults have a significant impact on children’s learning and well-being. One study examined the influence of different types of adult feedback on fifth-graders’ achievement goals, attributions, and performance (Mueller & Dweck, 1998). The researchers were particularly interested in how feedback about a child’s success would impact a child’s later response to failure, because of the common practice of praising children for their successes by telling them they are smart, good, and so on.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_235,"In the first experiment, children were given three sets of problems to solve. The first set was a moderately difficult one, so all the children did fairly well. At that point, all of the children were told, “Wow, you did very well on these problems.” No matter how they had actually done, all the children were told they had gotten 80% right. “That’s a really high score.” (Children were “debriefed” about the experiment later.) Then, roughly a third of the children were told, “You must be smart at these problems,” in effect giving them an entity or fixed-trait reason for their high score. A different third were told, “You must have worked hard at these problems,” implying an incremental theory of intelligence. The remaining children received no additional feedback. Presumably these children retain their native theory of intelligence, which in the general population is about 43% incremental and about 43% entity. (The rest do not fit clearly into either pattern.) Next, children were told they could do more problems, and were asked to choose what kind of problems they would like, as a measure of their achievement orientation. They were offered a choice of “Problems that aren’t too hard, so I don’t get many wrong,” “Problems that are pretty easy, so I’ll do well,” or “Problems that I’m pretty good at, so I can show that I’m smart” (p. 35). These first three options endorse performance goals and go along with an entity theory, spawning a desire to perform well in order to look intelligent. A fourth option endorsed a learning goal and thus an incremental theory: “Problems that I’ll learn a lot from even if I won’t look so smart.” After stating their preferred choice, children went on to instead do a second, more difficult set of problems that they were told the experimenter had previously chosen. Their own choices would be granted, the experimenter told them, if there was extra time at the end of the session. After completing the second set of problems, they were told they had performed a lot worse on it than on the first set. To check for the impact of the different kinds of success attribution feedback on response to this failure experience, children were next asked about their desire to take some more problems home with them, their enjoyment of the task, their perceptions about how they had done, and their attributions for how they had done. They were then given a third set of problems, which was moderately difficult, like the first set, to allow for an assessment of how the experimental intervention influenced performance. After this final task, all children were debriefed and told the second set of problems was much harder than the first, and was in fact designed for seventh-graders. The researchers ensured that all children felt proud of their performance before leaving the experiment. The results of this study are extremely interesting in terms of their implications for how rapidly children respond to feedback endorsing an entity or an incremental view. Regarding achievement motivation, 92% of the children who had received effort praise chose the learning goal after the first set of problems, by asking to receive additional problems that they would learn from. By comparison, just 8% of the children who had received the intelligence praise chose this option. The other 92% of the children who had received intelligence praise opted for problems that would be easy so they could look smart or do well. Among the children who had gotten no feedback, about half chose performance and half chose learning goals, in keeping with the baseline representation of entity and mastery theorists in the general U.S. population.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_236,"Children’s post-failure attributions after the second set of problems were also affected by the intervention. Those who had been praised for effort after the first problem set attributed their subsequent failure to diminished effort, whereas those who were praised for ability attributed their subsequent failure to lack of ability. Task enjoyment was also very much affected, with children who were praised for intelligence reporting less enjoyment of the task than children who were praised for effort. In terms of persistence, children praised for effort were more likely to want to take some additional problems home. Finally, performance on the third set of problems was also influenced by the intervention feedback after the first set. Children praised for effort did better on the third set of problems than they had on the first set, and children praised for intelligence performed worse. Children who had received no praise showed no change. Thus a single sentence of feedback attributing success to intelligence or effort was associated with a cascade of remarkably different reactions to a subsequent failure event. In five subsequent experiments, the researchers replicated and extended these basic findings. When people with an entity view of intelligence (enduring or induced by feedback) face failure, they attribute the failure to a fixed quality of the self. In the context of such an attribution, people avoid further challenge, instead seeking evidence that they are indeed smart. If brief experimenter feedback can have such a large impact on children, parent and teacher feedback, which continues over time and comes from people who are very important to a child, would be expected to have even more. As was discussed in chapter 5, even when teachers simply told children a test would show “how good you are in relation to other children your age,” children’s performance declined (Graham & Golan, 1991).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_237,"The studies just described show that a feedback event (or a short series of such events) can influence immediate reactions even in very young children. But mastery-oriented and helpless styles are not only temporary states of reaction to recent feedback. In the absence of particular feedback manipulations, children’s responses to challenging situations has been shown to remain stable from kindergarten until fifth grade (Ziegert, Kistner, Castro, & Robertson, 2001), and there is no reason to believe they change thereafter. The research suggests that how adults talk to children about their accomplishments has a host of important consequences. Dweck (1999) describes many other interesting outcomes and considerations regarding these two theories of self as malleable or fixed. The fact that adult feedback appears to push children toward adopting one or the other such view is what is important to the ideas of this chapter. Adult feedback that endorses a malleable view of intelligence is clearly better for children.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Teachers were advised to have this sense about themselves, and to pass this sense on to children.

It means marking them from 0 to 10. How can a zero correct anyone’s defects?” (1967a, p. 245). Instead, Dr. Montessori counseled that correction comes from the child’s own observation of his mistakes in the outcome, and that the materials the child works with should make it obvious to the child when he has erred (see the discussion in chapter 5 on the Control of Error).",Montessori,Academic/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Dr. Montessori clearly valued intrinsic over performance reasons for one’s work: “If work comes from an inner source, it is much more intense and much more fruitful” (1989, p. 85). Whether Montessori children do have more of a mastery orientation toward schoolwork than do children in traditional school situations is a question for empirical study. Children in other nontraditional school systems clearly do (for example, Boaler, 1997; Boaler & Staples, 2003).

Within each classroom, in many schools children are also grouped by ability level for each subject (“tracked”). By learning in this manner, children are removed from other children who are at very different levels. Their learning occurs in a narrow ability band. This is convenient to a factory model, since factories operate most efficiently if all of the raw materials are uniform.

To see if they imitated the model’s actions, children were given the objects immediately and again after a one-week delay. Regardless of the delay time, children who had seen a slightly older peer model replicated a greater number of complex action sequences than did children exposed to an adult model, suggesting the peer elicited more imitation. This is a fascinating finding in need of replication. Because only one model was used for each condition, it is possible that some other difference in the models besides their peer/adult status was responsible for the result. We know, for example, that people are particularly apt to imitate those with whom they have better rapport (Bernieri, 1988), and perhaps children felt more rapport with the child for reasons other than age.

At one point the child is alone with the toys, then the door opens and in walks not the mother but the stranger.

Approximately 70% of American babies respond in this way at 12 to 18 months, and they tend to develop most positively in the years to come.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_258,"Different patterns of child behavior characterize different attachment styles (Weinfield, Sroufe, Egeland, & Carlson, 1999) ... some babies appear to avoid the mother--they do not look her in the eye and seem determined to try to be independent. Other babies approach the mother but then push her away. These latter two patterns are characteristic of insecure attachment relationships, and children who display these forms of attachment fare less well over time.",Traditional,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_259,"As stated, long-term outcome studies favor the secure attachment style. For example, in one study, children whose attachment status had been classified when they were infants returned to the laboratory at 2 years of age to engage in some problem-solving tasks with their mothers. Children previously rated as securely attached were more competent problem solvers, were more persistent, showed more enthusiasm, and were also more compliant with their mothers (Matas, Arend, & Sroufe, 1978).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_260,"Another study had children return to the laboratory as 3-year-olds to engage in a competitive game with a stranger (Luetkenhaus, Grossmann, & Grossmann, 1985). Children who at 12 months had been classified as securely attached interacted more smoothly with the stranger than children previously classified as insecurely attached. When children were told they were not doing well in the game, securely attached children upped their efforts, whereas insecurely attached children decreased their efforts. After failing, securely attached children displayed sadness more openly, which child psychologists regard positively; internalizing or not showing one’s feelings is associated with such later problems as childhood depression.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_261,"Another study examined children’s attachment relations in infancy and their behavior in summer camp at ages 9 to 11 (Urban, Carlson, Egeland, & Sroufe, 1991). Children with insecure attachment histories were more likely to be rated as dependent on adults at camp. They formed fewer friendships and were less socially competent as well. ",Traditional,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_262,"Other studies have shown that even as they enter adulthood, people who were classified as securely attached infants have more friends, engage more actively with their peers, explore more, have higher self-esteem, and show more positive emotion than do adults with insecure attachment histories (Thompson, 1999; Weinfield et al., 1999). This is only a small sampling of an abundant literature showing that secure attachment in infancy predicts positive developmental outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_263,"The secure attachment construct has also been extended beyond its roots in infancy and applied to people’s representations of intimate relationships throughout the lifespan. The attachment Q-sort was developed to measure attachment security in the preschool and school years (Waters & Deane, 1985). For this measure, the child’s teacher or some other trained observer sorts preselected statements concerning a child’s possible profile into piles indicating whether the statements are more or less characteristic of the child. The statements are about such issues as how the child responds to fearful situations, the child’s predominant mood, and how often the child seeks proximity and comfort. Sort patterns are used to place children into the different attachment style categories, and these categories correspond closely with attachment classifications from the Strange Situation months or years earlier, and predict a similar range of developmental outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_264,"A measure used to assess attachment in adults is the Adult Attachment Interview, in which people are asked to describe their relationship with their parents (Bakermans-Kranenburg & Van Ijzendoorn, 1993; Hesse, 1999). Responses on this interview tend to be related to the interaction style of one’s current relationships (Treboux, Crowell, & Waters, 2004), to parenting behaviors (Adam, Gunnar, & Tanaka, 2004), and to one’s attachment classification as an infant. In one study, people who were tested in the Strange Situation as infants and as adults found that 72% of participants were classified with the convergent attachment styles at both time points (Waters, Merrick, Treboux, Crowell, & Albersheim, 2000). Thus, attachment is an enduring construct, applicable even beyond infancy.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_265,"Given the importance of the construct to predicting later competence and well-being, a pertinent question is what leads a child to have a particular type of relationship with the caregiver. Bowlby (1969) and Ainsworth (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) believed that an important antecedent factor in attachment style was adult sensitivity, and research has borne out that possibility (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Discussion following refers to maternal sensitivity because that was Ainsworth’s main concern, but the constructs seem to apply to any close caregiver. Important attachment relationships also of course develop with fathers (Grossmann et al., 2002), and they also appear to develop with day-care providers and teachers. Children growing up on Israeli kibbutzim become attached to their caregivers, and the quality of those relationships also predicts children’s outcomes (Oppenheim, Sagi, & Lamb, 1988). Children with a secure attachment to their kibbutz caregiver were later more goal directed and achievement oriented than were other children. This is consistent with work showing that American children’s relationships with their kindergarten teachers are related to their academic and behavioral outcomes through eighth grade (Hamre & Pianta, 2001).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_266,"Awareness requires that the mother be proximate to the infant so that she can perceive the infant’s signals. This aspect of attachment theory led to a concern beginning in the 1970s about whether babies placed in day care could become attached to their mothers. After many years of controversy, the recent National Study of Day Care, involving a representative sample of over 1,000 American children in a variety of day-care arrangements, has shown that use of day care has no significant impact on child-mother attachment relations (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). It is the mother’s awareness of signals when she is with the infant that appears to matter, and not that she is with the infant at all times. One might revise Ainsworth’s criteria for awareness, then, to read that the adult must be proximate to the infant for some reasonable amount of time, and when proximate, must be able to perceive the infant’s signals. A second aspect of awareness, besides proximity, is having a low perceiving threshold. The adult must notice the child’s signals.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_267,"The second major aspect of sensitivity for Ainsworth is accurate interpretation. Adults must interpret the babies’ signals for what they are, rather than distorting the signals in some way. Distortions could be caused by adults projecting their own needs on the infant, denying the infant’s needs because of their own needs, or any other biasing of the infant’s signals to accord with the adult’s own wishes and needs. Ainsworth noted that to overcome such proclivities, the adult must have self-insight. A second feature necessary to accurate interpretation, according to Ainsworth, is empathy. Adults who lack empathy, she said, would have detached, intellectual relations with babies instead of warm, sensitive ones. “A mother might be quite aware of and understand accurately the baby’s behavior and the circumstances leading to her baby’s distress or demands, but because she is unable to empathize with him -- unable to see things from the baby’s point to view--she may tease him back into good humor, mock him, laugh at him, or just ignore him” (Ainsworth, 1969, p. 2). Lack of empathy thus leads to inappropriate response.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_268,"Even correctly interpreted signals can be followed by inappropriate responses. The third main feature of sensitivity for Ainsworth is that the response to the perceived and accurately interpreted signal be an appropriate one. Ainsworth noted that in the first year, the appropriate response to the baby is almost always what the child “asks” for via his or her signals: pick the child up when the signal indicates a desire to be held, feed the child when the signal indicates hunger, and so on. After the first year, Ainsworth noted that doing exactly as the baby asks is no longer always the best response. As they get older, children increasingly need to adapt to the world, rather than always expecting the world to adapt to them. On the other hand, children also need to feel some sense of control or efficacy, as suggested by the research presented in chapter 3. Ainsworth advised that thebest response after age 1 is a compromise response that keeps the child’s long-range interests at heart.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_269,The final feature of sensitivity concerns timing of the response. Ainsworth noted that responses must be prompt to be effective. Adults who were devoted to a rigid feed or sleep schedule would be insensitive on this point. Responses need to be timed closely after the baby’s calls for attention for the baby to experience the efficacy of his or her actions.,Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_270,"Ainsworth’s theoretical ideas regarding sensitivity were compiled into a rating scale on which the sensitivity of primary caregivers to their children could be scored by trained observers watching mothers and children interact. Ainsworth’s original study of 23 mother-child pairs found a remarkably strong relationship between maternal sensitivity and child attachment classification (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Many studies have been done in the meantime, and the results are not as strong; some even fail to show a relationship. When results are inconsistent, the best response is a meta-analysis combining results across many studies. A recent meta-analysis of maternal sensitivity and attachment shows there is a relationship between the two factors, such that (in statistical terms) a child’s chances of being securely attached move from 38% if a mother is not sensitive to 62% if the mother is sensitive (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Because all scales and measures are prone to some degree of “measurement error,” the relationship in real terms might be stronger.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_271,"The issue of direction of effects naturally arises here. Perhaps the reason some mothers respond sensitively has to do with characteristics of the infant, and those infant characteristics lead to the later positive outcomes. In this view, the mother has no direct bearing on the child’s later outcomes. The obvious infant characteristic to consider is the child’s personality (or temperament), and studies have been done examining the relationship between child personality and attachment security (Vaughn & Bost, 1999). The upshot of these studies is that although personality predicts some aspects of behavior in the Strange Situation, it does not predict reunion behaviors, which are the most diagnostic of relationship quality.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_272,"One could still argue, however, that some aspect of the child is responsible for attachment classification. Experimental designs can address this. In fact, several intervention studies have been conducted, in which mothers were trained to respond more sensitively to their infants and changes in attachment classification following the intervention were examined. A recent meta-analysis of 88 intervention studies showed that short, focused interventions related to maternal sensitivity were effective both in making parents respond more sensitively to their infants and in changing infant attachment status (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van Ijzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). Such work strongly suggests that maternal sensitivity has a causal relationship to attachment classification.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_273,"Ainsworth’s rating scales were designed for observation of mothers with their infants. But a mother’s interaction style with a child evolves over time. Other research has looked at how parents of securely attached infants behave toward them somewhat later, as toddlers and preschoolers. One can view this as addressing how the sensitive pattern of responding adapts as children age. Mothers whose children were insecurely attached as infants tend to interact more intrusively with them in first and second grades (Egeland, Pianta, & O’Brien, 1993). Their interaction styles are more directive, such that they are more apt to tell their children exactly what to do. In contrast, parents of securely attached children tend not simply to tell the children what to do, but instead make suggestions, helping children to figure things out for themselves (Fagot, Gauvain, & Kavanagh, 1996; Frankel & Bates, 1990; Matas et al., 1978; Moss, 1992). They are closely involved, but nonintrusive. In Bruner’s (1975) terms, echoing Vygotsky, parents of securely attached children provide ideal scaffolds for children, structuring the environment such that children can internalize problem-solving strategies (see also Gauvain, 2001), whereas parents of insecurely attached children are more directive. Secure attachment styles in infancy are associated with parenting styles that evolve in positive ways as children get older.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_274,"Dr. Montessori advised that teachers show a degree of warmth and sensitivity that is reminiscent of the characteristics of parents whose children are securely attached. The focal period for forming attachment relationships (12 to 18 months) is of course usually prior to the age of entry into a Montessori classroom. Yet there is nothing to indicate that the adult behaviors associated with particular attachment styles cease to matter, and indeed those behaviors are consistent with literature suggesting optimal parenting practices for older children as well. As children get older, they still appear to need a safe haven and a secure base; they simply need it less often and feel comfortable venturing farther away.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_275,"Dr. Montessori saw the task of childhood as being to become increasingly independent, and the role of the adult as assisting children toward that independence. As is indicated in the quote above, Dr. Montessori maintained the teacher should serve as a safe haven whenever the child needs that. Yet when the child is ready to explore, the Montessori teacher was advised to be sensitive to the child’s need for increased independence, heeding the child’s call to “Help me to do it alone!” (Montessori, 1948/1976, p. 103).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_276,"To determine when a child needs a secure base, the Montessori teacher was advised to be very attentive to the children, with the observational acuity of a well-trained scientist. Indeed, Dr. Montessori (1917/1965) said, “The fundamental quality [teachers must possess was] a capacity for observation” (p. 130). Like the sensitive parents described by Ainsworth (1969), teachers’ thresholds for perceiving signals should be low. They should be trained to notice and correctly interpret the behavioral manifestations of the child’s inner state, in order to know what to do next. As is discussed later in the chapter with regard to teacher training, Dr. Montessori also advised teachers to develop self-understanding, so they do not misinterpret children’s signals in ways that align with their own needs.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_277,"When children are concentrating on work, Dr. Montessori held that they should be left alone, because during such moments, she believed, they are developing themselves. In chapter 3, I discussed the idea that concentration might be an engine of self-regulation, which is associated with many positive personality variables. Dr. Montessori saw concentration as the moment of self-development. Because of this theoretical stance, she held that teachers must watch for any concentrated purposeful movement, so as to let it go undisturbed; the child must be protected from stimuli that would break the concentration. For example, Dr. Montessori described an incident in which a child who had thus far been disorderly in school one day began to rearrange the furniture, with an expression of intense interest. The teacher was inclined to stop him, but Dr. Montessori saw his activity as coordinated toward a useful end, and manifesting that child’s first moments of concentration on purposeful activity in the classroom. According to Dr. Montessori, a sensitive teacher would leave a child alone in such actions, as long as the child was not disturbing others.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_278,"The Montessori teacher must also be sensitive to when the child is ready for something new, because “the brain always asks for work which becomes more complex” (Montessori, 1989, p. 89). After great concentration a child may need to rest or simply observe others (Montessori, 1989, p. 19), but at a certain point the child will be ready for more complex work. The teacher must be attuned to such moments, and give the child new work when the child is ready. Further, like parents of securely attached children in problem-solving situations, the Montessori teacher must structure the environment in such a way that children can make discoveries on their own. Telling children, as traditional teaching often involves, is associated with insecure attachment relationships.",Montessori,Cognitive/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Children must have “a teacher who looks on them with love and hope” (Montessori, 1989, p. 79). Yet at the same time, the adult’s ultimate control of the environment was clearly a high priority. The pitfalls of permissive adult attitudes were pointed out in her writing. “If freedom is understood as letting the children do as they like, using or more likely misusing, the things available, it is clear that only their ‘deviations’ are free to develop” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 206). Permissive parents are often thought of as ones who want to be their children’s friends; it is hard for them to exercise authority. Dr. Montessori saw the dangers in this: “The teacher must be superior and not just a friend. . . . [Children] need a dignified, mature person. . . . If they have no authority, they have no directive. Children need this support” (1989, p. 17). Some Montessori teachers, like some parents, err in this regard. They do not provide ultimate control over the environment, deal effectively with unproductive behaviors, or guide children’s decisions in positive ways. Freedom can thus be taken to an extreme, and Dr. Montessori counseled against this repeatedly. “One time I saw an entire class of disorganized children who were using the materials completely wrongly. The teacher drifted about in the class, silent as the Sphinx. . . . This teacher was committing a grave error: She feared disturbing their disorder, instead of attempting to establish the order” (Montessori, 1956, p. 140).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_306,"Another not uncommon error in Montessori teaching is the opposite one: for teachers to be overly rigid about the method, in a manner reminiscent of authoritarian parents. Dr. Montessori also spoke against an authoritarian stance: “The teacher can address the pupil energetically and severely and thus jolt him out of his behavior, but those who know their jobs well have means more effective than coercion for recalling the pupil to order” (1956, p. 141). Authoritarian parents tell children to do things because the parent says so; they do not reason with the child, and they appear to take on a stance that they are infallible. Yet adults who work with children have to admit to being fallible (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246). Education, she said, was traditionally “directed toward the suppression or bending of the child’s will, and the substitution for it of the teacher’s will, which demands from the child unquestioning obedience” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 252). Against the behaviorist trend, she said, “We cannot directly mold. . . . individual forms of character, intelligence, and feeling” (1917/1965, p. 9).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_307,"The degree to which Montessori teachers take an authoritative stance, and whether their degree of authoritativeness is associated with more optimal academic, social, and personal outcomes, are important issues for empirical research. Dr. Montessori’s ideas about how teachers should behave toward children were clearly in line with today’s research on parenting styles. They should provide an appropriately structured environment in which children are free to make their own decisions and discoveries. They should intervene only when children’s behavior is not constructive. They should have high expectations and give reasons, all with warm love.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_308,"The fact that teachers get reputations that hold across the years suggests that teacher orientations are more stable, but a wealth of research in psychology also shows that people are much more influenced by the situation they are in than we sometimes expect (Ross & Nisbett, 1991). Still, my guess is that a new class of children in the same school would not strongly affect a teacher’s responses and that teachers were the main causal factor in children’s responses. In addition, in chapter 3 I mentioned a study in which teachers were trained to give children more control in the classroom, and positive changes were observed in their students (De Charms, 1976).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_309,"The study of teacher responses and child outcomes mentioned earlier in this section was replicated in Russia and revealed the same basic pattern of results. Unfortunately, as children get older in traditional American schools, the schools increasingly take away, rather than increase, children’s autonomy. Research in psychology has shown that when teachers have independence goals for children, children tend to have more intrinsic motivation to learn, and also to be higher in self-esteem.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_310,"The current swing toward external testing standards promotes the opposite behaviors in teachers. In one study, when teachers were told their students would have to pass specific educational standards, teachers became more controlling, talked and commanded more, gave students less choice and autonomy, and expressed more criticism of students (Deci, Spiefel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kaufman, 1982). Both as children get older, and when standardized testing is emphasized, teachers in traditional schools become more prone to create classroom environments that are at odds with more optimal child outcomes. In the context of traditional education, teachers can attempt to overcome the negative effects of grades and testing, and the inherently competitive, comparative system they create. The system, however, was designed for their use, and as the current enthusiasm for high-stakes testing shows, as a culture we keep returning to it.

First, as was discussed with reference to authoritative parenting, Montessori teachers’ expectations are high. Children are expected to achieve a good deal both academically and socially in Montessori classrooms. They achieve this in part by their own self-control. The Montessori teacher’s goal is clearly the child’s self-regulation; the teacher’s task was well done when the teacher was needed only to give additional lessons. “Any pedagogical action, if it is to be efficacious in the training of little children, must tend to help the children to advance upon this road of independence” (Montessori, 1912/1964, p. 97).

Before concentration occurs, the directress may do more or less what she thinks best; she may interfere with the children’s activities as much as she thinks necessary” (1967a, p. 278).

excerpt_317,"If concentration leads to better self-regulation, as research presented in chapter 3 suggests it does, then teachers are probably most apt to see misbehavior in newly established Montessori classrooms, before children have begun to concentrate (although of course misbehavior might surface anytime!). Dr. Montessori was quite clear that any disruptive or socially unacceptable behavior should always be checked. She recommended doing so by redirection rather than punishment. “Interfere by all means to stop disturbances, but we need not punish or scold or admonish when we stop bad behavior; we can ask the child to come and pick flowers in the garden or offer a toy or any occupation that will appeal to [the child]” (Montessori, 1989, p. 16).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_318,"She also recommended that misbehaving children be shown positive attention, such as being taken aside and shown something new as though they are very special. Thus at this stage, and indeed whenever a child is not productively engaged, misbehaving children should be interrupted and redirected. In this manner Dr. Montessori seemed to be endorsing authoritative parenting: high warmth and high control. She believed there was no such thing as a bad child, only children with unfulfilled needs (Montessori, 1989, p. 78).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_319,"Eventually, as a new classroom settles, children will one by one begin to concentrate. She suggested that once children have begun to concentrate, the adult step back. She often described the adult’s role at this point, once children have begun to concentrate, as passive, but she clearly meant a very attentive sort of passivity. “Passive” apparently only referred to the idea that the adult not interfere with the child’s concentration. She stated that adults often err by praising children who are concentrating, or by correcting their errors. Both, she said, lead children to abandon their work in moments of concentration. Praise and correction at the wrong time disrupt the very process that one was aiming for.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

She mentions that children, particularly early on, will bring the products of their work to adults and ask for praise, and at such times, she advised adults to give praise warmly and generously. The claim that calling a child “good” is a form of betrayal suggests she would not condone person praise, but leaves open whether she would condone product or process praise or both. When a child comes to an adult seeking praise, she said, then the child needs praise as assurance that he or she is on the right track (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 88).

This training includes both personal preparation as well as education in the lessons and materials.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_324,"An ability to observe children and detect their needs is fundamental to good Montessori teaching. Dr. Montessori maintained that the capacity to observe children has to be carefully developed through long practice (1917/1965, p. 130). In the AMI Montessori teacher training courses, scores of hours are spent with children, observing their actions, recording those observations, and crafting them into reports to be reviewed by the teacher trainer. Dr. Montessori advocated training in science, rather than in education, for people who would go into Montessori teaching, in part because training in science is training in close observation (Montessori, 1917/1965, p. 138). She was also concerned that training in traditional education might make it more difficult to become a good Montessori teacher. “An ordinary teacher cannot be transformed into a Montessori teacher, but must be created anew, having rid herself of pedagogical prejudices” (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 87).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

This is reminiscent of Ainsworth’s discussion of sensitivity, in which the sensitive mother is free from distortions caused by her own needs and desires, a state that aids her in seeing the child’s signals for what they are. This emphasis on one’s personal preparation to be a teacher contrasts sharply with traditional teacher training, which focuses more on how one does things than on one’s own psychology. In fact, the Montessori approach is more in keeping with training psychoanalysts, since they must go through analysis themselves first.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_326,"To teach about the material and its presentation, AMI teacher training generally requires nine months of lecture with internships in a variety of Montessori classrooms and observation time intermingled. The teacher trainer oversees the trainee’s learning of lessons and supervises the internships and observations. Lectures and practicums enable trainees to learn about the materials and the variety of ways in which they can be used to stimulate interest and use, as well as the interconnections between materials across the curriculum. Trainees learn to present the materials, with all the variations, to children (by practicing on the trainer and fellow trainees prior to internships).",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Effectively, the Montessori teacher-in-training writes his or her own textbook concerning Montessori materials and theory. The knowledge in these albums is of course not as deep and thorough as that of the teacher trainer, just as the notes of a student taking a college course would not reflect all the knowledge of the professor, but they are sufficiently thorough to allow the teacher to refer to them over the coming years, and to guide his or her lessons in the future. Some other Montessori teacher training courses routinely give teachers copies of the information rather than having them write and illustrate it themselves. This is not a good change: research has shown that taking one’s own notes leads to better learning than does reading prewritten ones (Annis, 1981; Kulhavy, Dyer, & Silver, 1975).",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

The children’s task is to arrange the prisms from smallest to largest, creating a stair. The mathematical concept of squares is inherent in the materials, as it would take four of the first prism to make the second, nine of the first to make the third, and so on. In building the stair, the child is introduced to the rudiments of such concepts and is given a reason to attend to relative height and width (to arrange them in sequence).

The shortest one is 10 cm long, and each successive one is 10 cm longer than the previous one, so the longest rod is 100 cm. One Montessori teacher observed to me that some children do not appear even to see the difference in these lengths at first, but must learn to perceive the difference. The teacher assists the child’s learning by showing the child how widely one has to stretch one’s arms to hold the longest one versus a shorter one, how the rods differ in weight, and so on. With the help of their bodies, children learn to perceive the differences in the Red Rods and to line them up from shortest to longest.

The structural organization involved was a diorama of a miniature town, into which 20 small items, including animals, cars, people, and so on, were logically placed while the children, Maya and American 8- and 9-year-olds, looked on. The 20 objects were then replaced into the pool of 80 items from which they were drawn, and the children were asked to reconstruct the scene. Although the Maya sample had shown much poorer memory previously on a standard list task, their performance was even slightly better than that of the American children in this organized task. Although children learn to memorize lists of unrelated items in Traditional schools, one might question whether this is a good use of their processing resources.Transitive inference tasks are ones in which one learns that A > B and B > C, and one must infer that A > C. When the stimuli from which children made inferences were arranged in a physical order that mirrored their conceptual relations, children made correct inferences significantly more often than when the stimuli were arranged randomly.

excerpt_489,"She also made interesting observations about how children play hiding games that pertain to order. Dr. Montessori recounted that Piaget once played a hiding game with one of his children, hiding an object under a pillow, having his child leave the room, moving the object to another pillow, and then asking the child to find it. When the child did not see the object under the first pillow, the child gave up. Piaget then showed the child how he had moved the object, and repeated the procedure. The child behaved in exactly the same way, whereupon Piaget lifted the second pillow and asked, ""Didn’t you see I put it here?"" (on the prior hiding trial). ""Yes,"" his child replied, ""but it should be there"" (pointing to the first pillow) (Montessori, 1966, pp. 53–54). Although to Piaget this task was probably about inference, to Dr. Montessori the incident was about the child’s need to find the object in its proper place. She also noted that children often play hide-and-seek by hiding in the same place over and over, or in the place where the last hider was just found. She saw this as also reflecting a need for order, for there being set places and times for objects and events.

Vygotsky argued that learning occurs in a zone of proximal development, meaning over tasks one cannot yet accomplish alone but can accomplish in the company of a more advanced other. In his view, slightly advanced peers serve as important leaders of development (Hogan & Tudge, 1999; Vygotsky, 1978).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_498,". In the early 1960s, the psychologist Albert Bandura provided the classic evidence that learning can occur through observation and imitation (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963). Bandura showed children films of an adult hitting a wobbly blow-up “Bobo” doll and noted that children were later apt to behave toward the doll as the adult had. According to behaviorists, such learning should not have occurred, because children were not rewarded directly for the behaviors they later enacted. The studies made the point that learning can occur by simply watching what others do, irrespective of personal rewards. Along with other important developments at the time, Bandura’s work helped to turn the dominant paradigm of American psychology from behaviorism to cognitive science",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_499,"Dr. Montessori described an early case in which it became apparent to her that children’s tendency to imitate others can be a useful source of inlearning from peers 197 spiration in school, advancing children to new abilities. This observation, called the “explosion” into writing, recurs annually in well-functioning Montessori Primary classrooms when the first 4-year-old suddenly realizes, after months of working with the preparatory materials, that he or she can write. “The first word to be written by one of them brought a great outburst of joy and laughter. Everyone looked admiringly at ‘the writer,’ and thus they felt moved to follow his example. ‘I can do it too!’ they cried. The achievement of one started off the whole group” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 231). Other 4-year-olds, having also been indirectly prepared to write through the use of knobs on Wooden Cylinders and other materials, pencils in Metal Insets, and so on, as was described in chapter 1, spontaneously began writing in reaction to having observed a first child reaching that landmark. Obviously children also see others learn to write in traditional schools; what is unique in Montessori is the series of steps, all visible and imitable, that lead children along the path to writing, so that a community of 4-year-olds can discover they already have the ability to write once they see it done by another child.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_500,"Children also can learn about social behavior in Montessori classrooms by observing how others behave in natural, nonscripted situations. Whereas in traditional classrooms, children learn how to sit still and listen to the teacher, in Montessori, they can learn how to interact with each other. The oldest children in the classroom can serve as examples to the younger ones. “The undisciplined child enters into discipline by working in the company of others, not by being told that he is naughty” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246).",Montessori,Social,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_501,".

excerpt_502,"One might wonder how learning by observation in a Montessori classroom is possible for the oldest children, who are working at the highest levels with many of the available materials.

excerpt_505,"One study of the efficacy of such a system (“Classwide Peer Tutoring”) involved first- and second-grade classrooms in low-income schools (Greenwood et al., 1987). Classrooms were randomly assigned to tutoring and control conditions for spelling. In control classrooms, teachers used standard methods of teaching spelling: a workbook with word lists and vocabulary exercises, chalkboard, self-study, and homework assignments. In classrooms that used the tutoring program, the tutoring process described earlier replaced some in-class spelling work. Over the two years of the study, children in the peer tutoring classrooms were spelling 87% of the words correctly on average, whereas children in other classrooms were spelling 75% of words correctly. This is not an enormous difference, but it is certainly a meaningful one. Peering tutoring programs also appear to confer many social benefits on the classroom (Fantuzzo, Riggio, Connelly, & Dimeff, 1989; Maheady & Sainato, 1985). In addition, they apparently benefit learning other topics and over the long term",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_506,"In one demonstration of these benefits, a follow-up study expanded the peer tutoring to cover reading, math, and language, and examined children’s performance over multiple years. Children in the tutoring program performed significantly better than those in the control group on all three topics both immediately and two years later, when they had moved on to middle school and no longer had the program. They also performed better in two nontutored topics: science and social studies. They even performed as well as children in a higher SES group in all these areas (Greenwood et al., 1989). In addition, fewer children from the peer tutoring group were placed in special-education classes (Greenwood, Terry, Utley, Montagna, & Walker, 1993). This study is among many suggesting that peer tutoring programs, appropriately structured, improve learning in traditional schools and that the benefits extend across time and topics (see Topping & Ehly, 1998).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_507,"Peer tutoring programs vary in terms of how structured each tutoring session is, and more structured programs are typically associated with greater success. Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) is an example of a more structured tutoring program (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998), and it has also been used to examine the effect of rewards. RPT begins with training sessions about teamwork and cooperation, and children are told they can win rewards by using teamwork. In the RPT program, teaching aides show the children how to tutor each other. Then RPT sessions are held twice weekly for 45 minutes each. Special flash-card materials are used, with a problem on one side and steps to the solution on the other. Children decide who will be tutor first in each session, and work for 10 minutes on problems before switching roles. After the initial 20 minutes, problem drill sheets are administered, and students attempt the problems, then switch papers with partners for correction. Performance on the drill sheets accrues points, which lead to such rewards as being teacher’s helper or working on a special project. When children were randomly assigned to RPT versus traditional instruction groups, those in the RPT groups consistently showed higher levels of mathematics achievement (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998). Two alternative groups were also formed, one with the reward but lacking the structure provided by the flash cards, and the other having the structure but no reward. The combination of rewards and structure led to the most gains in both achievement and positive social behavior. Structure alone, without rewards, was associated with better behavior both in the tutoring sessions and in the regular classroom situation. Students also perceived themselves to be more competent when using structured than when using unstructured tutoring, but achievement was not improved in the absence of rewards (Fantuzzo, King, & Heller, 1992). Thus, within a traditional school environment, more structured peer interactions with a reward structure optimized learning and behavior. The issue of rewards is important and is discussed further in the context of collaborative learning.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_508,"Although supplementing whole-class teaching with peer tutoring improves achievement, adults are even more effective tutors than peers. The research suggests several reasons for this that shed light on how peer tutoring can be most effective. First, adults structure the task in ways that keep the overarching goal in clear focus, whereas child partners tend to focus on parts of the problem, losing sight of the whole--a difference reminiscent of the differences between same-age experts and novices. For example, if the task is planning a route for doing a set of errands as efficiently as possible, child pairs will get the errands done, but not as efficiently, because they focus on each individual item to be retrieved separately, rather than thinking about how several items can be grouped to make for more efficient routes. Adult tutors get children to think about grouping items. However, when the peer tutor is trained in this task and taught to consider how to group items, tutee performance does improve. Nonetheless, performance even with a trained peer tutor does not improve to the level obtained when the tutor was an adult (Gauvain, 2001).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_509,"A second probable reason for the greater success of adult tutors is that adults tend to include children more in the task at hand. Other children can become autocratic, as children are inclined to focus on who gets to do what. Children tend to like to do; adults more easily sit back, watch, and guide. Research has shown that peer learning is also more successful when peers listen to each other and question each other more (reviewed below), skills that many adults have but many children have not yet learned (Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_510,"Perhaps in part because peer tutors can become autocratic, some research suggests that, when tutored by a peer, the tutee benefits maximally from a peer who is just a bit more advanced rather than much more advanced. For example, research on both scientific and moral reasoning has shown that children benefit from exposure to thought processes that are just above their current level (Damon & Killen, 1982; Kuhn, 1972; Turiel & Rothman, 1972)",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_511,"Besides being less able to adapt to a lower level of tutee, much older and more advanced peer tutors sometimes practice social dominance. The problems of autocracy mentioned earlier thus become exacerbated, and the tutee learns less, because he or she is less involved in the decision-making process. This was found in a study in which 5-year-old novices were paired either with 5- or 7-year-olds who were considered experts at planning routes (as in the study just described) (Duran & Gauvain, 1993). Children were more involved with the task when paired with an advanced planner of their own age, as opposed to an older planner, and this increased involvement predicted better performance. Whether the particular age gap used in this experiment (5 to 7) is a particularly problematic one would be an interesting topic for research. The age of 6 is a pivotal one, recognized in many of the world’s cultures as an appropriate time to ask more of children, such as by beginning formal schooling (Rogoff, 1981). Six is the age at which Piaget speculated children advance to being able to perform mental operations (for example, imagining addition and subtraction), and which Dr. Montessori considered transitional between her first and second planes of development. At each plane, she said, children think differently. Examining whether 6- and 8-, or 7- and 9-year-olds, make more effective tutoring pairs would be of interest. The research suggests that peers who are slightly advanced, but not too advanced, make more optimal tutors, but it might also be the case that tutors who are within particular age spans are best",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

After hearing the first story, children who did not solve it spontaneously (about 80% of them) were shown the solution. The second story was about a man who needed to get hay bales on a high tractor--a problem that could also be solved by stacking items. Some children were simply told the story, whereas others were asked to teach the solution to a Kermit the Frog puppet.

He reasoned that close student contact, for the purpose of helping others, might alleviate problems, and so created learning arrangements that would lead to such contact. In the Jigsaw model, children are placed in groups of five or six and topics of study are broken into as many segments. For the topic of the Civil War, for example, one person might be assigned to study the history of slavery, another the type of weapons used in the era, another the major battles, 210 Montessori and so on. Children research their topic on their own, and then temporarily join a new group composed of the child from every other group in the class who was assigned their same topic. These “homogenous” groups share information and practice presentations of their topics. Finally, children reunite with their original groups, and each child teaches the material. A test on all the material generally follows. The Jigsaw method has repeatedly been found to improve learning as well as classroom social relations (Aronson, 2002; Bridgeman, 1981; Lazarowitz, Hertz-Lazarowitz, & Baird, 1994). In terms of academic achievement, it is particularly successful with minority youths, but in some cases it has improved, and in no cases (to my knowledge) has it negatively affected, the learning of other students (Lucker, Rosenfield, Sikes, & Aronson, 1977; Slavin, 1983).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

Children who worked together and were encouraged to talk were most likely to solve the puzzles and produced the most interpretive talk. Even when children were alone and encouraged to talk to themselves, their use of interpretive talk was positively related to their ability to solve the puzzles. Descriptive talk, which is more characteristic of children in the kindergarten years, was associated with low levels of performance on the problem-solving tasks. The children who performed the worst were ones who worked alongside others but were discouraged from talking at all, which is the typical arrangement in traditional elementary schools. In contrast, children at these ages in Montessori schools tend to work together, and they frequently talk while they work.

For the other two conditions, children were simply allowed to draw with the markers for six minutes and then were unexpectedly given a Good Player Award, or they drew for six minutes and no award was ever mentioned. A panel of judges who were blind to what condition the children had been in rated the drawings’ creativity. Drawings done by children who expected rewards were judged as significantly lower in quality than drawings done in the other two conditions. This was the first finding. The second one was that a few weeks later, when the classroom was observed for marker use, children who had expected a reward used the markers much less than they had previously, and half as much as the other children.

Eight undergraduates who wrote headlines for a college newspaper participated, and their average time for writing a headline was measured. For the reward condition, four of the headline writers were offered 50 cents per headline written over a three-week period. The average time each participant took to write headlines during the three weeks before the reward period was compared with their time during the three weeks after the reward period.

All children read a passage, then were asked how much they enjoyed the passage, how difficult it was, and how pressured they felt. Then they were told they would read a second passage, with directions that varied by condition. Some children were told, ""After you are finished, I’m going to test you on it. I want to see how much you can remember. You should work as hard as you can, because I’ll be grading you on the test to see if you’re learning well enough."" Another group of children was told, ""After you are finished, I’ll be asking you some questions similar to the ones I just asked about the other passage."" Recall that these questions were about their personal reactions to the passages. After answering the questions about interest, pressure, and difficulty for the second reading, the children were asked to recall as much of the second 160 Montessori passage as they could. To test for conceptual learning, they were also asked to write an essay on the main point of the passage. To test long-term retention, a week later, children were asked to once again recall the second passage by rote and to write an essay describing the passage’s main point. The results were highly suggestive of what expectations about getting a grade do for learning. Students who thought they would be graded rendered the passage by rote best at the first test, but had also forgotten the most a week later, making their long-term retention equal to that of the children who thought they would be questioned only about their personal reactions. At second testing, the ""personal-reaction"" children retained almost all of the rote information reported at the first session. But rote learning is usually not what we really value, after all. Conceptual learning--drawing the main point from what we read--is much more important, and the results here are compelling. The essays of the students who did not expect a test or a grade showed significantly greater conceptual learning than did the essays of the children who did expect one. The upshot is that students who expect to be tested initially learn the facts better, by rote, but as soon as the test is over, they forget much of what they learned.

Correct solutions to the first 9 problems all involved a particular pattern of use of three jugs, but a correct solution to the 10th one involved just two jugs, so the 10th problem was a set breaker: it required that the participant break a response set to consider a problem in a new way. What was of interest was not whether problems were solved correctly, since that was expected, but instead how long it took to solve them, particularly the set breaker. Whereas participants in both groups took equally long on the initial 9 items, the set-breaking 10th problem took participants in the nonreward condition only about half as long to solve as the participants who were trying for the $1 bonus.

To cement this promise, they signed an elaborate vow to later write the story. Other children also took two pictures before writing their story, but it was not construed as an advance reward. A second manipulation was that for half of the children in each group, the activities were labeled play, and for half they were labeled work. The researchers expected that the play label would be associated with higher creativity. The results indicated no significant effect of the work or play label on creativity, but a significant effect of how the picture taking was construed.

A second opportunity to sort papers arose later, while waiting for the experimenter to find a tape recorder. During this time, other activities such as reading comic books were also available. Children’s mothers also contributed to the data by describing how they used rewards for their children’s behaviors at home and how prosocial their children were. Children in the reward condition spent significantly less time sorting paper during the second, free-choice period than did children who did not receive a reward. Therefore motivation to subsequently engage in prosocial acts was negatively impacted by a prior expected reward. A particularly interesting finding is the relationship between mothers’ habitual use of rewards and children’s responses. Children whose mothers reported that they liked and used extrinsic rewards at home were most affected by the reward manipulation. They sorted significantly less paper, on average, and fewer than half of them sorted any paper at all at the second opportunity.

excerpt_552,"One interesting study examined the impact of grades on self theories, goals, and performance in sixth-graders using tasks with both fixed and open-ended solutions (Butler & Nisan, 1986). Some of the fixed-solution tests were word games, such as making as many words as possible from the letters of a long word and constructing new words using the first and last letters of a prior word. The open-ended tasks included a ""creative uses"" task in which one comes up with as many uses as possible for an object, and a ""circles"" task, in which one is given a page of nickel-sized circles to draw on, and the creativity of one’s drawings is rated. All children performed similarly on a pre-test composed of these tasks. Two days later, some of the children were surprised by the return of their test booklets with either verbal feedback specifying how they could have performed better (""You wrote many short words, but not many long ones"") or a score. All of the children then engaged in slightly different versions of the same tasks. A third session two hours later repeated the original tasks, and children answered questions regarding their motivation on the tasks and the sources of their performance. An important factor to remember for the results of these experiments is that they were conducted in the children’s school classroom, in a manner reminiscent of school assignments. By sixth grade, students have learned that what one does in school is important only when there is evaluative extrinsic rewards and motivation 167 feedback. Unfortunately, university students often appear to feel the same way, visibly going on vacation when told something will not be on the exam. In keeping with this, students who had not gotten their test booklets back before the second session (no feedback) did not perform as well as the others on the later tests. They probably did not see the assignment as important and did not put in effort. Consistent with other studies, the two different kinds of feedback led to differences in performance on the open-ended tasks (not on the fixedsolution ones). For example, students who received verbal feedback about how to do better thought of more uses for objects later than did students who had received grades. In addition, students who received comments reported higher levels of motivation on and more liking for the tasks than did those who received grades. What was new about this study was that grades and comments also had different impacts on what the students felt contributed to their performance: their theories of intelligence. Students who received comments attributed their performance to effort, interest, and skill, whereas students who received grades were more apt to attribute their performance to the reader’s mood: an external, uncontrollable variable. If one has an incremental theory, skill is something one can control. The reader’s mood, on the other hand, is outside one’s control. The literature on learned helplessness and issues discussed in chapter 3 arise. As was discussed there, entity theorists tend to feel helpless in the face of failure. Attributions of effort aligned with these different perceptions of what underlay their performance. Students in the grades group attributed their effort to a desire to avoid failure, whereas those who received comments attributed their effort to their interest in the task. The entity theorists’ performance goals are thus apparent in the group who received grades. Grades and other evaluations, then, undermine motivation perhaps in part because they tend to lead to performance goals instead of mastery ones. Grades appear to lead children to view their level of performance as reflecting their being smart or dumb, not as indicative of having studied hard or not.",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,

For example, their teacher (mentioned by name) presented them with three Mars bars (their favorite candy) on their birthday, and if they cut each candy bar in half, how many friends could they share with?

Their enjoyment of the game, their own assessment of their performance, and their desired level of challenge in future games were also assessed. The results were quite clear. When interesting contexts had been provided, children showed better knowledge of how parentheses affect arithmetic operations and were better able to transfer that knowledge to non-computer contexts. Personalization augmented these effects. In addition, students’ motivation was clearly influenced by the manipulation. Students in the context conditions were much more likely to opt for the computer playing its best game, liked the game more, were more willing to stay after school to play the game, believed themselves to be better at the games, and indicated they would seek a more challenging game later.

Autonomy scores were found to align significantly with their students’ judgments of the atmosphere in the classroom, suggesting good correspondence between how students see the teacher and what the teacher thinks is appropriate to do. This data in hand, the authors went on to examine the level of intrinsic motivation and perceived competence of students in these teachers’ classes, testing in both October and May of a regular academic year.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Just two months into the school year, children were more intrinsically motivated when they had teachers who promoted autonomy in the classroom. In addition, children whose teachers endorsed autonomy-encouraging approaches perceived themselves to be more cognitively competent and had a higher sense of self-worth. In contrast, when teachers endorsed more controlling and social-comparison strategies, children had less intrinsic motivation and a lower sense of competence in the classroom.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_571,"Whereas the attachment and parenting literatures concern how adults respond to children and child outcomes, the work on self theories concerns children’s representations of the self and how malleable these are to adult feedback. As was mentioned in chapter 5, people’s responses to challenges can be seen as fitting into two basic categories (Dweck, 1999). One is mastery oriented: people aim to overcome the challenges. Such people view mistakes as learning opportunities, and when they err, they continue to engage in the task with the aim of mastering it. The second is a helpless pattern, in which people back down from challenges, opting for easier tasks instead. They tend to view mistakes as reflections of some permanent defect of their character, and thus they seek to avoid tasks that will cast themselves in a negative light.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_572,"The two kinds of responses go along with two different theories of intelligence. The helpless pattern goes along with a theory of intelligence as a fixed entity, and the mastery pattern goes along with a theory of intelligence as malleable. Chapter 5 discussed studies indicating that grading appears to push people to adopt the performance goals that go with an entity theory of intelligence and choose activities that will indicate that they are highly intelligent. By contrast, mastery-oriented responses promote choosing of tasks that help one learn, which inspire one to master challenging tasks (Dweck, 1999).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_573,"Dweck and her colleagues have shown that by implicitly endorsing one or the other theory, adults have a significant impact on children’s learning and well-being. One study examined the influence of different types of adult feedback on fifth-graders’ achievement goals, attributions, and performance (Mueller & Dweck, 1998). The researchers were particularly interested in how feedback about a child’s success would impact a child’s later response to failure, because of the common practice of praising children for their successes by telling them they are smart, good, and so on.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_574,"In the first experiment, children were given three sets of problems to solve. The first set was a moderately difficult one, so all the children did fairly well. At that point, all of the children were told, “Wow, you did very well on these problems.” No matter how they had actually done, all the children were told they had gotten 80% right. “That’s a really high score.” (Children were “debriefed” about the experiment later.) Then, roughly a third of the children were told, “You must be smart at these problems,” in effect giving them an entity or fixed-trait reason for their high score. A different third were told, “You must have worked hard at these problems,” implying an incremental theory of intelligence. The remaining children received no additional feedback. Presumably these children retain their native theory of intelligence, which in the general population is about 43% incremental and about 43% entity. (The rest do not fit clearly into either pattern.) Next, children were told they could do more problems, and were asked to choose what kind of problems they would like, as a measure of their achievement orientation. They were offered a choice of “Problems that aren’t too hard, so I don’t get many wrong,” “Problems that are pretty easy, so I’ll do well,” or “Problems that I’m pretty good at, so I can show that I’m smart” (p. 35). These first three options endorse performance goals and go along with an entity theory, spawning a desire to perform well in order to look intelligent. A fourth option endorsed a learning goal and thus an incremental theory: “Problems that I’ll learn a lot from even if I won’t look so smart.” After stating their preferred choice, children went on to instead do a second, more difficult set of problems that they were told the experimenter had previously chosen. Their own choices would be granted, the experimenter told them, if there was extra time at the end of the session. After completing the second set of problems, they were told they had performed a lot worse on it than on the first set. To check for the impact of the different kinds of success attribution feedback on response to this failure experience, children were next asked about their desire to take some more problems home with them, their enjoyment of the task, their perceptions about how they had done, and their attributions for how they had done. They were then given a third set of problems, which was moderately difficult, like the first set, to allow for an assessment of how the experimental intervention influenced performance. After this final task, all children were debriefed and told the second set of problems was much harder than the first, and was in fact designed for seventh-graders. The researchers ensured that all children felt proud of their performance before leaving the experiment. The results of this study are extremely interesting in terms of their implications for how rapidly children respond to feedback endorsing an entity or an incremental view. Regarding achievement motivation, 92% of the children who had received effort praise chose the learning goal after the first set of problems, by asking to receive additional problems that they would learn from. By comparison, just 8% of the children who had received the intelligence praise chose this option. The other 92% of the children who had received intelligence praise opted for problems that would be easy so they could look smart or do well. Among the children who had gotten no feedback, about half chose performance and half chose learning goals, in keeping with the baseline representation of entity and mastery theorists in the general U.S. population.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_575,"Children’s post-failure attributions after the second set of problems were also affected by the intervention. Those who had been praised for effort after the first problem set attributed their subsequent failure to diminished effort, whereas those who were praised for ability attributed their subsequent failure to lack of ability. Task enjoyment was also very much affected, with children who were praised for intelligence reporting less enjoyment of the task than children who were praised for effort. In terms of persistence, children praised for effort were more likely to want to take some additional problems home. Finally, performance on the third set of problems was also influenced by the intervention feedback after the first set. Children praised for effort did better on the third set of problems than they had on the first set, and children praised for intelligence performed worse. Children who had received no praise showed no change. Thus a single sentence of feedback attributing success to intelligence or effort was associated with a cascade of remarkably different reactions to a subsequent failure event. In five subsequent experiments, the researchers replicated and extended these basic findings. When people with an entity view of intelligence (enduring or induced by feedback) face failure, they attribute the failure to a fixed quality of the self. In the context of such an attribution, people avoid further challenge, instead seeking evidence that they are indeed smart. If brief experimenter feedback can have such a large impact on children, parent and teacher feedback, which continues over time and comes from people who are very important to a child, would be expected to have even more. As was discussed in chapter 5, even when teachers simply told children a test would show “how good you are in relation to other children your age,” children’s performance declined (Graham & Golan, 1991).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_576,"The studies just described show that a feedback event (or a short series of such events) can influence immediate reactions even in very young children. But mastery-oriented and helpless styles are not only temporary states of reaction to recent feedback. In the absence of particular feedback manipulations, children’s responses to challenging situations has been shown to remain stable from kindergarten until fifth grade (Ziegert, Kistner, Castro, & Robertson, 2001), and there is no reason to believe they change thereafter. The research suggests that how adults talk to children about their accomplishments has a host of important consequences. Dweck (1999) describes many other interesting outcomes and considerations regarding these two theories of self as malleable or fixed. The fact that adult feedback appears to push children toward adopting one or the other such view is what is important to the ideas of this chapter. Adult feedback that endorses a malleable view of intelligence is clearly better for children.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_577,"Consistent with Dweck’s findings, Dr. Montessori was against using any sort of entity evaluation of a child, positive or negative. “To tell a person he is clever or clumsy, bright or stupid, good or bad, is a form of betrayal. The child must see for himself what he can do, and it is important to give him not only the means of education but also to supply him with indicators which tell him his mistakes. . . .

Teachers were advised to have this sense about themselves, and to pass this sense on to children. An attitude that mistakes are valuable because we can learn from them is consistent with a mastery approach to learning and with an incremental theory of intelligence.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_579,"Not correcting children’s work was part of this incremental approach. Dr. Montessori held that children naturally correct their mistakes when they can perceive those mistakes, just as a baby corrects his or her own mistakes in learning to walk. A child learns through repetition of exercises where the mistakes are obvious, she claimed, not from an adult’s correcting his or her work. “What is meant by correcting exercise books? It means marking them from 0 to 10. How can a zero correct anyone’s defects?” (1967a, p. 245). Instead, Dr. Montessori counseled that correction comes from the child’s own observation of his mistakes in the outcome, and that the materials the child works with should make it obvious to the child when he has erred (see the discussion in chapter 5 on the Control of Error).",Montessori,Academic/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Having children find their own errors through the materials and work to master materials for their own sakes would be expected to lead to (or preserve) a mastery orientation in Montessori children. Dr. Montessori clearly valued intrinsic over performance reasons for one’s work: “If work comes from an inner source, it is much more intense and much more fruitful” (1989, p. 85). Whether Montessori children do have more of a mastery orientation toward schoolwork than do children in traditional school situations is a question for empirical study. Children in other nontraditional school systems clearly do (for example, Boaler, 1997; Boaler & Staples, 2003).

Children can stop and daydream for a time, pick up a recreational book, engage in free drawing, perhaps go outside and play, and so on. Of course, children are not free to abandon their education, and the teacher is responsible for noticing if a child is not using time wisely and intervening if needed.

excerpt_585,"To the extent that children might interact with other children in traditional schooling arrangements, those others are usually of about the same age and ability. One might say that children are grouped in narrow bands. The first band is by age level: most of the children in the classroom are born within one year of each other, with a set birth date as the cut-off for being part of a classroom. Within each classroom, in many schools children are also grouped by ability level for each subject (“tracked”). By learning in this manner, children are removed from other children who are at very different levels. Their learning occurs in a narrow ability band. This is convenient to a factory model, since factories operate most efficiently if all of the raw materials are uniform. It suits the Lockean model of the child as well, since children at the same level are assumed to be alike and thus ready for the same knowledge to be poured in.",Traditional,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

While sitting on their mothers’ laps, the children observed the model performing action sequences such as inserting a ball into a plastic egg, closing the egg, and shaking it. To see if they imitated the model’s actions, children were given the objects immediately and again after a one-week delay. Regardless of the delay time, children who had seen a slightly older peer model replicated a greater number of complex action sequences than did children exposed to an adult model, suggesting the peer elicited more imitation. This is a fascinating finding in need of replication. Because only one model was used for each condition, it is possible that some other difference in the models besides their peer/adult status was responsible for the result. We know, for example, that people are particularly apt to imitate those with whom they have better rapport (Bernieri, 1988), and perhaps children felt more rapport with the child for reasons other than age.

The older children are interested in the younger, and the younger in the older” (Montessori, 1989, pp. 68–69). A child enters the Primary classroom at 21 ⁄2 or 3 years of age and remains there until he or she has completed the “cycle of materials,” the full set of materials Dr. Montessori determined was optimal for a Primary classroom.

The psychologist Mary Ainsworth (1967), Bowlby’s colleague, moved the attachment construct from the theoretical to the empirical realm by establishing a method to assess attachment.

Over the next 15 or 20 minutes, the mother and a stranger come and go in a series of prearranged episodes. At one point the child is alone with the toys, then the door opens and in walks not the mother but the stranger. This is often very upsetting to the child, who usually already appeared stressed over being left alone.

For this measure, the child’s teacher or some other trained observer sorts preselected statements concerning a child’s possible profile into piles indicating whether the statements are more or less characteristic of the child. The statements are about such issues as how the child responds to fearful situations, the child’s predominant mood, and how often the child seeks proximity and comfort.

In one study, people who were tested in the Strange Situation as infants and as adults found that 72% of participants were classified with the convergent attachment styles at both time points (Waters, Merrick, Treboux, Crowell, & Albersheim, 2000). Thus, attachment is an enduring construct, applicable even beyond infancy.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_604,"Given the importance of the construct to predicting later competence and well-being, a pertinent question is what leads a child to have a particular type of relationship with the caregiver. Bowlby (1969) and Ainsworth (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) believed that an important antecedent factor in attachment style was adult sensitivity, and research has borne out that possibility (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Discussion following refers to maternal sensitivity because that was Ainsworth’s main concern, but the constructs seem to apply to any close caregiver. Important attachment relationships also of course develop with fathers (Grossmann et al., 2002), and they also appear to develop with day-care providers and teachers. Children growing up on Israeli kibbutzim become attached to their caregivers, and the quality of those relationships also predicts children’s outcomes (Oppenheim, Sagi, & Lamb, 1988). Children with a secure attachment to their kibbutz caregiver were later more goal directed and achievement oriented than were other children. This is consistent with work showing that American children’s relationships with their kindergarten teachers are related to their academic and behavioral outcomes through eighth grade (Hamre & Pianta, 2001).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_605,"Awareness requires that the mother be proximate to the infant so that she can perceive the infant’s signals. This aspect of attachment theory led to a concern beginning in the 1970s about whether babies placed in day care could become attached to their mothers. After many years of controversy, the recent National Study of Day Care, involving a representative sample of over 1,000 American children in a variety of day-care arrangements, has shown that use of day care has no significant impact on child-mother attachment relations (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). It is the mother’s awareness of signals when she is with the infant that appears to matter, and not that she is with the infant at all times. One might revise Ainsworth’s criteria for awareness, then, to read that the adult must be proximate to the infant for some reasonable amount of time, and when proximate, must be able to perceive the infant’s signals. A second aspect of awareness, besides proximity, is having a low perceiving threshold. The adult must notice the child’s signals.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_606,"The second major aspect of sensitivity for Ainsworth is accurate interpretation. Adults must interpret the babies’ signals for what they are, rather than distorting the signals in some way. Distortions could be caused by adults projecting their own needs on the infant, denying the infant’s needs because of their own needs, or any other biasing of the infant’s signals to accord with the adult’s own wishes and needs. Ainsworth noted that to overcome such proclivities, the adult must have self-insight. A second feature necessary to accurate interpretation, according to Ainsworth, is empathy. Adults who lack empathy, she said, would have detached, intellectual relations with babies instead of warm, sensitive ones. “A mother might be quite aware of and understand accurately the baby’s behavior and the circumstances leading to her baby’s distress or demands, but because she is unable to empathize with him -- unable to see things from the baby’s point to view--she may tease him back into good humor, mock him, laugh at him, or just ignore him” (Ainsworth, 1969, p. 2). Lack of empathy thus leads to inappropriate response.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_607,"Even correctly interpreted signals can be followed by inappropriate responses. The third main feature of sensitivity for Ainsworth is that the response to the perceived and accurately interpreted signal be an appropriate one. Ainsworth noted that in the first year, the appropriate response to the baby is almost always what the child “asks” for via his or her signals: pick the child up when the signal indicates a desire to be held, feed the child when the signal indicates hunger, and so on. After the first year, Ainsworth noted that doing exactly as the baby asks is no longer always the best response. As they get older, children increasingly need to adapt to the world, rather than always expecting the world to adapt to them. On the other hand, children also need to feel some sense of control or efficacy, as suggested by the research presented in chapter 3. Ainsworth advised that thebest response after age 1 is a compromise response that keeps the child’s long-range interests at heart.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_608,The final feature of sensitivity concerns timing of the response. Ainsworth noted that responses must be prompt to be effective. Adults who were devoted to a rigid feed or sleep schedule would be insensitive on this point. Responses need to be timed closely after the baby’s calls for attention for the baby to experience the efficacy of his or her actions.,Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_609,"Ainsworth’s theoretical ideas regarding sensitivity were compiled into a rating scale on which the sensitivity of primary caregivers to their children could be scored by trained observers watching mothers and children interact. Ainsworth’s original study of 23 mother-child pairs found a remarkably strong relationship between maternal sensitivity and child attachment classification (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Many studies have been done in the meantime, and the results are not as strong; some even fail to show a relationship. When results are inconsistent, the best response is a meta-analysis combining results across many studies. A recent meta-analysis of maternal sensitivity and attachment shows there is a relationship between the two factors, such that (in statistical terms) a child’s chances of being securely attached move from 38% if a mother is not sensitive to 62% if the mother is sensitive (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Because all scales and measures are prone to some degree of “measurement error,” the relationship in real terms might be stronger.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_610,"The issue of direction of effects naturally arises here. Perhaps the reason some mothers respond sensitively has to do with characteristics of the infant, and those infant characteristics lead to the later positive outcomes. In this view, the mother has no direct bearing on the child’s later outcomes. The obvious infant characteristic to consider is the child’s personality (or temperament), and studies have been done examining the relationship between child personality and attachment security (Vaughn & Bost, 1999). The upshot of these studies is that although personality predicts some aspects of behavior in the Strange Situation, it does not predict reunion behaviors, which are the most diagnostic of relationship quality.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_611,"One could still argue, however, that some aspect of the child is responsible for attachment classification. Experimental designs can address this. In fact, several intervention studies have been conducted, in which mothers were trained to respond more sensitively to their infants and changes in attachment classification following the intervention were examined. A recent meta-analysis of 88 intervention studies showed that short, focused interventions related to maternal sensitivity were effective both in making parents respond more sensitively to their infants and in changing infant attachment status (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van Ijzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). Such work strongly suggests that maternal sensitivity has a causal relationship to attachment classification.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_612,"Ainsworth’s rating scales were designed for observation of mothers with their infants. But a mother’s interaction style with a child evolves over time. Other research has looked at how parents of securely attached infants behave toward them somewhat later, as toddlers and preschoolers. One can view this as addressing how the sensitive pattern of responding adapts as children age. Mothers whose children were insecurely attached as infants tend to interact more intrusively with them in first and second grades (Egeland, Pianta, & O’Brien, 1993). Their interaction styles are more directive, such that they are more apt to tell their children exactly what to do. In contrast, parents of securely attached children tend not simply to tell the children what to do, but instead make suggestions, helping children to figure things out for themselves (Fagot, Gauvain, & Kavanagh, 1996; Frankel & Bates, 1990; Matas et al., 1978; Moss, 1992). They are closely involved, but nonintrusive. In Bruner’s (1975) terms, echoing Vygotsky, parents of securely attached children provide ideal scaffolds for children, structuring the environment such that children can internalize problem-solving strategies (see also Gauvain, 2001), whereas parents of insecurely attached children are more directive. Secure attachment styles in infancy are associated with parenting styles that evolve in positive ways as children get older.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_613,"Dr. Montessori advised that teachers show a degree of warmth and sensitivity that is reminiscent of the characteristics of parents whose children are securely attached. The focal period for forming attachment relationships (12 to 18 months) is of course usually prior to the age of entry into a Montessori classroom. Yet there is nothing to indicate that the adult behaviors associated with particular attachment styles cease to matter, and indeed those behaviors are consistent with literature suggesting optimal parenting practices for older children as well. As children get older, they still appear to need a safe haven and a secure base; they simply need it less often and feel comfortable venturing farther away.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_614,"Dr. Montessori saw the task of childhood as being to become increasingly independent, and the role of the adult as assisting children toward that independence. As is indicated in the quote above, Dr. Montessori maintained the teacher should serve as a safe haven whenever the child needs that. Yet when the child is ready to explore, the Montessori teacher was advised to be sensitive to the child’s need for increased independence, heeding the child’s call to “Help me to do it alone!” (Montessori, 1948/1976, p. 103).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_615,"To determine when a child needs a secure base, the Montessori teacher was advised to be very attentive to the children, with the observational acuity of a well-trained scientist. Indeed, Dr. Montessori (1917/1965) said, “The fundamental quality [teachers must possess was] a capacity for observation” (p. 130). Like the sensitive parents described by Ainsworth (1969), teachers’ thresholds for perceiving signals should be low. They should be trained to notice and correctly interpret the behavioral manifestations of the child’s inner state, in order to know what to do next. As is discussed later in the chapter with regard to teacher training, Dr. Montessori also advised teachers to develop self-understanding, so they do not misinterpret children’s signals in ways that align with their own needs.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_616,"When children are concentrating on work, Dr. Montessori held that they should be left alone, because during such moments, she believed, they are developing themselves. In chapter 3, I discussed the idea that concentration might be an engine of self-regulation, which is associated with many positive personality variables. Dr. Montessori saw concentration as the moment of self-development. Because of this theoretical stance, she held that teachers must watch for any concentrated purposeful movement, so as to let it go undisturbed; the child must be protected from stimuli that would break the concentration. For example, Dr. Montessori described an incident in which a child who had thus far been disorderly in school one day began to rearrange the furniture, with an expression of intense interest. The teacher was inclined to stop him, but Dr. Montessori saw his activity as coordinated toward a useful end, and manifesting that child’s first moments of concentration on purposeful activity in the classroom. According to Dr. Montessori, a sensitive teacher would leave a child alone in such actions, as long as the child was not disturbing others.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_617,"The Montessori teacher must also be sensitive to when the child is ready for something new, because “the brain always asks for work which becomes more complex” (Montessori, 1989, p. 89). After great concentration a child may need to rest or simply observe others (Montessori, 1989, p. 19), but at a certain point the child will be ready for more complex work. The teacher must be attuned to such moments, and give the child new work when the child is ready. Further, like parents of securely attached children in problem-solving situations, the Montessori teacher must structure the environment in such a way that children can make discoveries on their own. Telling children, as traditional teaching often involves, is associated with insecure attachment relationships.",Montessori,Cognitive/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_618,"Children with insecure attachments have parents who behave in two opposing ways.

excerpt_619,"Dr. Montessori appears to have explicitly advised against both of these errors well in advance of the research on attachment: “We must never force our caresses on him, greatly as we may be attracted by his fascinating graces; nor must we ever repel his outbursts of affection, even when we are not disposed to receive them, but must respond with sincere and delicate devotion” (1917/1965, p. 332).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Behaviorist approaches, notably that of Thorndike, specified that the teacher’s role was to establish useful bonds in the child’s mind and eliminate useless and negative ones. Being businesslike was important in this approach as well; such concepts as “emotional warmth” do not figure prominently in behaviorist discourse; in the rare instances when Thorndike mentions emotional qualities for a teacher, it tends to be in a footnote (e.g., Thorndike, 1906/1962, p. 63). Thorndike’s recommendation for how a teacher should give instructions, for example, was to say, “Do the work on this page. Do it again, keeping track of how many minutes you spend. Practice again until you can get all the answers right in 12 minutes” (Thorndike, 1921b, p. 17). Communication was to be simple, direct, and dry.

Children apparently surprised her repeatedly by showing interest in real activities over play, and she responded by creating an educational system that expects maturity, as do authoritative parents. This can put people off, because they see Montessori education as not being sufficiently fun. Empirical research should more directly address this issue, but the Middle School study mentioned previously (Rathunde & Csikszentmihalyi, in press) and other work concerning children’s motivation and affect when engaged in Montessori-like practices (collaborative learning, lack of extrinsic rewards, and so) in traditional settings suggest that it is probably not a concern.

excerpt_644,"As was discussed earlier, Dr. Montessori advised that adults show great emotional warmth when dealing with children. Children must have “a teacher who looks on them with love and hope” (Montessori, 1989, p. 79). Yet at the same time, the adult’s ultimate control of the environment was clearly a high priority. The pitfalls of permissive adult attitudes were pointed out in her writing. “If freedom is understood as letting the children do as they like, using or more likely misusing, the things available, it is clear that only their ‘deviations’ are free to develop” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 206). Permissive parents are often thought of as ones who want to be their children’s friends; it is hard for them to exercise authority. Dr. Montessori saw the dangers in this: “The teacher must be superior and not just a friend. . . . [Children] need a dignified, mature person. . . . If they have no authority, they have no directive. Children need this support” (1989, p. 17). Some Montessori teachers, like some parents, err in this regard. They do not provide ultimate control over the environment, deal effectively with unproductive behaviors, or guide children’s decisions in positive ways. Freedom can thus be taken to an extreme, and Dr. Montessori counseled against this repeatedly. “One time I saw an entire class of disorganized children who were using the materials completely wrongly. The teacher drifted about in the class, silent as the Sphinx. . . . This teacher was committing a grave error: She feared disturbing their disorder, instead of attempting to establish the order” (Montessori, 1956, p. 140).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_645,"Another not uncommon error in Montessori teaching is the opposite one: for teachers to be overly rigid about the method, in a manner reminiscent of authoritarian parents.

Authoritarian parents tell children to do things because the parent says so; they do not reason with the child, and they appear to take on a stance that they are infallible. Yet adults who work with children have to admit to being fallible (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246). Education, she said, was traditionally “directed toward the suppression or bending of the child’s will, and the substitution for it of the teacher’s will, which demands from the child unquestioning obedience” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 252). Against the behaviorist trend, she said, “We cannot directly mold. . . . individual forms of character, intelligence, and feeling” (1917/1965, p. 9).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Both as children get older, and when standardized testing is emphasized, teachers in traditional schools become more prone to create classroom environments that are at odds with more optimal child outcomes. In the context of traditional education, teachers can attempt to overcome the negative effects of grades and testing, and the inherently competitive, comparative system they create.

Before concentration occurs, the directress may do more or less what she thinks best; she may interfere with the children’s activities as much as she thinks necessary” (1967a, p. 278).

She recommended doing so by redirection rather than punishment. “Interfere by all means to stop disturbances, but we need not punish or scold or admonish when we stop bad behavior; we can ask the child to come and pick flowers in the garden or offer a toy or any occupation that will appeal to [the child]” (Montessori, 1989, p. 16).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_657,"She also recommended that misbehaving children be shown positive attention, such as being taken aside and shown something new as though they are very special. Thus at this stage, and indeed whenever a child is not productively engaged, misbehaving children should be interrupted and redirected. In this manner Dr. Montessori seemed to be endorsing authoritative parenting: high warmth and high control. She believed there was no such thing as a bad child, only children with unfulfilled needs (Montessori, 1989, p. 78).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

She often described the adult’s role at this point, once children have begun to concentrate, as passive, but she clearly meant a very attentive sort of passivity. “Passive” apparently only referred to the idea that the adult not interfere with the child’s concentration. She stated that adults often err by praising children who are concentrating, or by correcting their errors. Both, she said, lead children to abandon their work in moments of concentration. Praise and correction at the wrong time disrupt the very process that one was aiming for.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_659,"Dr. Montessori was not against all praise. She mentions that children, particularly early on, will bring the products of their work to adults and ask for praise, and at such times, she advised adults to give praise warmly and generously. The claim that calling a child “good” is a form of betrayal suggests she would not condone person praise, but leaves open whether she would condone product or process praise or both. When a child comes to an adult seeking praise, she said, then the child needs praise as assurance that he or she is on the right track (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 88).

Dr. Montessori established training courses and the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) to oversee training of future teachers and continuing evolution of the Montessori program.

This training includes both personal preparation as well as education in the lessons and materials.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_663,"An ability to observe children and detect their needs is fundamental to good Montessori teaching. Dr. Montessori maintained that the capacity to observe children has to be carefully developed through long practice (1917/1965, p. 130). In the AMI Montessori teacher training courses, scores of hours are spent with children, observing their actions, recording those observations, and crafting them into reports to be reviewed by the teacher trainer. Dr. Montessori advocated training in science, rather than in education, for people who would go into Montessori teaching, in part because training in science is training in close observation (Montessori, 1917/1965, p. 138). She was also concerned that training in traditional education might make it more difficult to become a good Montessori teacher. “An ordinary teacher cannot be transformed into a Montessori teacher, but must be created anew, having rid herself of pedagogical prejudices” (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 87).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_664,"Teachers had to rid themselves of pride and anger, to become humble and charitable, and to “check those inner attitudes characteristic of adults that can hinder our understanding of a child” (Montessori, 1966, p. 153). This is reminiscent of Ainsworth’s discussion of sensitivity, in which the sensitive mother is free from distortions caused by her own needs and desires, a state that aids her in seeing the child’s signals for what they are. This emphasis on one’s personal preparation to be a teacher contrasts sharply with traditional teacher training, which focuses more on how one does things than on one’s own psychology. In fact, the Montessori approach is more in keeping with training psychoanalysts, since they must go through analysis themselves first.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_665,"To teach about the material and its presentation, AMI teacher training generally requires nine months of lecture with internships in a variety of Montessori classrooms and observation time intermingled. The teacher trainer oversees the trainee’s learning of lessons and supervises the internships and observations. Lectures and practicums enable trainees to learn about the materials and the variety of ways in which they can be used to stimulate interest and use, as well as the interconnections between materials across the curriculum. Trainees learn to present the materials, with all the variations, to children (by practicing on the trainer and fellow trainees prior to internships).",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Effectively, the Montessori teacher-in-training writes his or her own textbook concerning Montessori materials and theory. The knowledge in these albums is of course not as deep and thorough as that of the teacher trainer, just as the notes of a student taking a college course would not reflect all the knowledge of the professor, but they are sufficiently thorough to allow the teacher to refer to them over the coming years, and to guide his or her lessons in the future. Some other Montessori teacher training courses routinely give teachers copies of the information rather than having them write and illustrate it themselves. This is not a good change: research has shown that taking one’s own notes leads to better learning than does reading prewritten ones (Annis, 1981; Kulhavy, Dyer, & Silver, 1975).",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

When the child did not see the object under the first pillow, the child gave up. Piaget then showed the child how he had moved the object, and repeated the procedure.

Yet this is opposite to what we know about children: preschoolers often prefer parallel play, since their social skills are often not well honed. In elementary school, children become intensely social, and really want to interact with each other",Traditional,Social,Example,excerpt,Education for Children,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_830,"Montessori works with children the way they are. It capitalizes on the fact that children can learn very well from peers and excellent materials, freeing the teacher to work with children individually and in small groups. Elementary school children usually love to work together, children learn well when they work together, and in Montessori classrooms, they can do so.",Montessori,Social,Example,excerpt,Education for Children,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_831,"Traditional schooling often separates learning from the context of use. One result is that sometimes children learn information and procedures in school, but cannot see how they are relevant or can be applied outside of the school context",Traditional,Academic,Example,excerpt,Education for Children,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_832,"In Montessori classrooms, the hands-on materials provide a context that can make application more obvious. As children get older, individual interests take them out into the community via the Going Out program, allowing learning to be directly connected to the contexts from which it arises and to which it applies",Montessori,Academic ,Example,excerpt,Education for Children,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_833,"Traditional schooling does not appear to mandate any one way that a teacher should teach, but psychological research clearly suggests more optimal ways for adults to interact with children.

They are harmed by evaluations that suggest static personal qualities, even positive ones",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Education for Children,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_834,"Dr. Montessori captured these optimal styles of interaction in her discussions of how a teacher should behave toward the children.

excerpt_836,"Because mental development occurs when the child has to resolve disequilibrium by changing his or her mind, or “accommodating,” to incorporate new ideas, peers can be an important engine of development (De Lisi & Golbeck, 1999; Piaget, 1926). Vygotsky argued that learning occurs in a zone of proximal development, meaning over tasks one cannot yet accomplish alone but can accomplish in the company of a more advanced other. In his view, slightly advanced peers serve as important leaders of development (Hogan & Tudge, 1999; Vygotsky, 1978).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_837,". In the early 1960s, the psychologist Albert Bandura provided the classic evidence that learning can occur through observation and imitation (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963). Bandura showed children films of an adult hitting a wobbly blow-up “Bobo” doll and noted that children were later apt to behave toward the doll as the adult had. According to behaviorists, such learning should not have occurred, because children were not rewarded directly for the behaviors they later enacted. The studies made the point that learning can occur by simply watching what others do, irrespective of personal rewards. Along with other important developments at the time, Bandura’s work helped to turn the dominant paradigm of American psychology from behaviorism to cognitive science",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_838,"Dr. Montessori described an early case in which it became apparent to her that children’s tendency to imitate others can be a useful source of inlearning from peers 197 spiration in school, advancing children to new abilities. This observation, called the “explosion” into writing, recurs annually in well-functioning Montessori Primary classrooms when the first 4-year-old suddenly realizes, after months of working with the preparatory materials, that he or she can write. “The first word to be written by one of them brought a great outburst of joy and laughter. Everyone looked admiringly at ‘the writer,’ and thus they felt moved to follow his example. ‘I can do it too!’ they cried. The achievement of one started off the whole group” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 231). Other 4-year-olds, having also been indirectly prepared to write through the use of knobs on Wooden Cylinders and other materials, pencils in Metal Insets, and so on, as was described in chapter 1, spontaneously began writing in reaction to having observed a first child reaching that landmark. Obviously children also see others learn to write in traditional schools; what is unique in Montessori is the series of steps, all visible and imitable, that lead children along the path to writing, so that a community of 4-year-olds can discover they already have the ability to write once they see it done by another child.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_839,"Children also can learn about social behavior in Montessori classrooms by observing how others behave in natural, nonscripted situations. Whereas in traditional classrooms, children learn how to sit still and listen to the teacher, in Montessori, they can learn how to interact with each other. The oldest children in the classroom can serve as examples to the younger ones. “The undisciplined child enters into discipline by working in the company of others, not by being told that he is naughty” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246).",Montessori,Social,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_840,". Dr. Montessori also noted that by observing older children, younger ones can see what they will later be able to do themselves, and that this is motivating. “To understand what the older ones are doing fills the little ones with enthusiasm” (1967a, p. 228).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_841,"One might wonder how learning by observation in a Montessori classroom is possible for the oldest children, who are working at the highest levels with many of the available materials. Facilitating their learning by observation, Dr. Montessori urged that children be allowed to visit other classrooms. “The classroom for those of three to six is not even rigidly separated from that of the children from seven to nine. Thus, children of six can get ideas from the class above. . . . One can always go for an intellectual walk!” (1967a, p 227).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_842,"In contrast, in traditional schools, people’s sense is usually that smaller classes are better for children. Research on this is actually equivocal, at least as regards achievement (Ehrenberg, Brewer, Gamoran, & Willms, 2001).",Traditional,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_843,"Anecdotally, Montessorians report that when more than one adult is active in a classroom, children are less apt to work independently and with each other, but turn instead to an adult. Other arguments for a single teacher, such as integration of knowledge, were discussed in chapter 4.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_844,"One study of the efficacy of such a system (“Classwide Peer Tutoring”) involved first- and second-grade classrooms in low-income schools (Greenwood et al., 1987). Classrooms were randomly assigned to tutoring and control conditions for spelling. In control classrooms, teachers used standard methods of teaching spelling: a workbook with word lists and vocabulary exercises, chalkboard, self-study, and homework assignments. In classrooms that used the tutoring program, the tutoring process described earlier replaced some in-class spelling work. Over the two years of the study, children in the peer tutoring classrooms were spelling 87% of the words correctly on average, whereas children in other classrooms were spelling 75% of words correctly. This is not an enormous difference, but it is certainly a meaningful one. Peering tutoring programs also appear to confer many social benefits on the classroom (Fantuzzo, Riggio, Connelly, & Dimeff, 1989; Maheady & Sainato, 1985). In addition, they apparently benefit learning other topics and over the long term",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_845,"In one demonstration of these benefits, a follow-up study expanded the peer tutoring to cover reading, math, and language, and examined children’s performance over multiple years. Children in the tutoring program performed significantly better than those in the control group on all three topics both immediately and two years later, when they had moved on to middle school and no longer had the program. They also performed better in two nontutored topics: science and social studies. They even performed as well as children in a higher SES group in all these areas (Greenwood et al., 1989). In addition, fewer children from the peer tutoring group were placed in special-education classes (Greenwood, Terry, Utley, Montagna, & Walker, 1993). This study is among many suggesting that peer tutoring programs, appropriately structured, improve learning in traditional schools and that the benefits extend across time and topics (see Topping & Ehly, 1998).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_846,"Peer tutoring programs vary in terms of how structured each tutoring session is, and more structured programs are typically associated with greater success. Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) is an example of a more structured tutoring program (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998), and it has also been used to examine the effect of rewards. RPT begins with training sessions about teamwork and cooperation, and children are told they can win rewards by using teamwork. In the RPT program, teaching aides show the children how to tutor each other. Then RPT sessions are held twice weekly for 45 minutes each. Special flash-card materials are used, with a problem on one side and steps to the solution on the other. Children decide who will be tutor first in each session, and work for 10 minutes on problems before switching roles. After the initial 20 minutes, problem drill sheets are administered, and students attempt the problems, then switch papers with partners for correction. Performance on the drill sheets accrues points, which lead to such rewards as being teacher’s helper or working on a special project. When children were randomly assigned to RPT versus traditional instruction groups, those in the RPT groups consistently showed higher levels of mathematics achievement (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998). Two alternative groups were also formed, one with the reward but lacking the structure provided by the flash cards, and the other having the structure but no reward. The combination of rewards and structure led to the most gains in both achievement and positive social behavior. Structure alone, without rewards, was associated with better behavior both in the tutoring sessions and in the regular classroom situation. Students also perceived themselves to be more competent when using structured than when using unstructured tutoring, but achievement was not improved in the absence of rewards (Fantuzzo, King, & Heller, 1992). Thus, within a traditional school environment, more structured peer interactions with a reward structure optimized learning and behavior. The issue of rewards is important and is discussed further in the context of collaborative learning.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_847,"Although supplementing whole-class teaching with peer tutoring improves achievement, adults are even more effective tutors than peers. The research suggests several reasons for this that shed light on how peer tutoring can be most effective. First, adults structure the task in ways that keep the overarching goal in clear focus, whereas child partners tend to focus on parts of the problem, losing sight of the whole--a difference reminiscent of the differences between same-age experts and novices. For example, if the task is planning a route for doing a set of errands as efficiently as possible, child pairs will get the errands done, but not as efficiently, because they focus on each individual item to be retrieved separately, rather than thinking about how several items can be grouped to make for more efficient routes. Adult tutors get children to think about grouping items. However, when the peer tutor is trained in this task and taught to consider how to group items, tutee performance does improve. Nonetheless, performance even with a trained peer tutor does not improve to the level obtained when the tutor was an adult (Gauvain, 2001).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_848,"A second probable reason for the greater success of adult tutors is that adults tend to include children more in the task at hand. Other children can become autocratic, as children are inclined to focus on who gets to do what. Children tend to like to do; adults more easily sit back, watch, and guide. Research has shown that peer learning is also more successful when peers listen to each other and question each other more (reviewed below), skills that many adults have but many children have not yet learned (Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_849,"Perhaps in part because peer tutors can become autocratic, some research suggests that, when tutored by a peer, the tutee benefits maximally from a peer who is just a bit more advanced rather than much more advanced. For example, research on both scientific and moral reasoning has shown that children benefit from exposure to thought processes that are just above their current level (Damon & Killen, 1982; Kuhn, 1972; Turiel & Rothman, 1972)",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_850,"Besides being less able to adapt to a lower level of tutee, much older and more advanced peer tutors sometimes practice social dominance. The problems of autocracy mentioned earlier thus become exacerbated, and the tutee learns less, because he or she is less involved in the decision-making process. This was found in a study in which 5-year-old novices were paired either with 5- or 7-year-olds who were considered experts at planning routes (as in the study just described) (Duran & Gauvain, 1993). Children were more involved with the task when paired with an advanced planner of their own age, as opposed to an older planner, and this increased involvement predicted better performance. Whether the particular age gap used in this experiment (5 to 7) is a particularly problematic one would be an interesting topic for research. The age of 6 is a pivotal one, recognized in many of the world’s cultures as an appropriate time to ask more of children, such as by beginning formal schooling (Rogoff, 1981). Six is the age at which Piaget speculated children advance to being able to perform mental operations (for example, imagining addition and subtraction), and which Dr. Montessori considered transitional between her first and second planes of development. At each plane, she said, children think differently. Examining whether 6- and 8-, or 7- and 9-year-olds, make more effective tutoring pairs would be of interest. The research suggests that peers who are slightly advanced, but not too advanced, make more optimal tutors, but it might also be the case that tutors who are within particular age spans are best",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

After hearing the first story, children who did not solve it spontaneously (about 80% of them) were shown the solution. The second story was about a man who needed to get hay bales on a high tractor--a problem that could also be solved by stacking items. Some children were simply told the story, whereas others were asked to teach the solution to a Kermit the Frog puppet. Children who taught Kermit the Frog spontaneously came up with the solution to the second story of the pairs twice as frequently as children who were simply read the story",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_854,"The psychologist Elliot Aronson designed the Jigsaw program initially to address the disturbances that followed the integration of public schools in Austin, Texas, in the 1960s (Aronson & Patnoe, 1997). He reasoned that close student contact, for the purpose of helping others, might alleviate problems, and so created learning arrangements that would lead to such contact. In the Jigsaw model, children are placed in groups of five or six and topics of study are broken into as many segments. For the topic of the Civil War, for example, one person might be assigned to study the history of slavery, another the type of weapons used in the era, another the major battles, 210 Montessori and so on. Children research their topic on their own, and then temporarily join a new group composed of the child from every other group in the class who was assigned their same topic. These “homogenous” groups share information and practice presentations of their topics. Finally, children reunite with their original groups, and each child teaches the material. A test on all the material generally follows. The Jigsaw method has repeatedly been found to improve learning as well as classroom social relations (Aronson, 2002; Bridgeman, 1981; Lazarowitz, Hertz-Lazarowitz, & Baird, 1994). In terms of academic achievement, it is particularly successful with minority youths, but in some cases it has improved, and in no cases (to my knowledge) has it negatively affected, the learning of other students (Lucker, Rosenfield, Sikes, & Aronson, 1977; Slavin, 1983).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

Children who worked together and were encouraged to talk were most likely to solve the puzzles and produced the most interpretive talk. Even when children were alone and encouraged to talk to themselves, their use of interpretive talk was positively related to their ability to solve the puzzles. Descriptive talk, which is more characteristic of children in the kindergarten years, was associated with low levels of performance on the problem-solving tasks. The children who performed the worst were ones who worked alongside others but were discouraged from talking at all, which is the typical arrangement in traditional elementary schools. In contrast, children at these ages in Montessori schools tend to work together, and they frequently talk while they work.

To test long-term retention, a week later, children were asked to once again recall the second passage by rote and to write an essay describing the passage’s main point. The results were highly suggestive of what expectations about getting a grade do for learning. Students who thought they would be graded rendered the passage by rote best at the first test, but had also forgotten the most a week later, making their long-term retention equal to that of the children who thought they would be questioned only about their personal reactions. At second testing, the ""personal-reaction"" children retained almost all of the rote information reported at the first session. But rote learning is usually not what we really value, after all. Conceptual learning--drawing the main point from what we read--is much more important, and the results here are compelling. The essays of the students who did not expect a test or a grade showed significantly greater conceptual learning than did the essays of the children who did expect one. The upshot is that students who expect to be tested initially learn the facts better, by rote, but as soon as the test is over, they forget much of what they learned. Results from tests taken under such conditions are therefore probably not indicative of long-term knowledge gains.

excerpt_879,"The expectation of rewards and evaluation also interferes with problem solving (McGraw & McCullers, 1979).

How can the boy get exactly 3 quarts of water using only these containers and not guessing at the amount?"" (p. 287). Half were told that they would receive a nickel for each correct solution, and a $1 bonus if all 10 solutions were correct. Correct solutions to the first 9 problems all involved a particular pattern of use of three jugs, but a correct solution to the 10th one involved just two jugs, so the 10th problem was a set breaker: it required that the participant break a response set to consider a problem in a new way. What was of interest was not whether problems were solved correctly, since that was expected, but instead how long it took to solve them, particularly the set breaker. Whereas participants in both groups took equally long on the initial 9 items, the set-breaking 10th problem took participants in the nonreward condition only about half as long to solve as the participants who were trying for the $1 bonus.

To cement this promise, they signed an elaborate vow to later write the story. Other children also took two pictures before writing their story, but it was not construed as an advance reward. A second manipulation was that for half of the children in each group, the activities were labeled play, and for half they were labeled work. The researchers expected that the play label would be associated with higher creativity. The results indicated no significant effect of the work or play label on creativity, but a significant effect of how the picture taking was construed.

Judges rated the quality of the drawings of the noncompetitive group more highly.

A second opportunity to sort papers arose later, while waiting for the experimenter to find a tape recorder. During this time, other activities such as reading comic books were also available. Children’s mothers also contributed to the data by describing how they used rewards for their children’s behaviors at home and how prosocial their children were. Children in the reward condition spent significantly less time sorting paper during the second, free-choice period than did children who did not receive a reward. Therefore motivation to subsequently engage in prosocial acts was negatively impacted by a prior expected reward. A particularly interesting finding is the relationship between mothers’ habitual use of rewards and children’s responses. Children whose mothers reported that they liked and used extrinsic rewards at home were most affected by the reward manipulation. They sorted significantly less paper, on average, and fewer than half of them sorted any paper at all at the second opportunity. Children whose mothers did not use rewards at home were much less impacted by rewards, and 85% of them helped by sorting paper.

excerpt_891,"One interesting study examined the impact of grades on self theories, goals, and performance in sixth-graders using tasks with both fixed and open-ended solutions (Butler & Nisan, 1986). Some of the fixed-solution tests were word games, such as making as many words as possible from the letters of a long word and constructing new words using the first and last letters of a prior word. The open-ended tasks included a ""creative uses"" task in which one comes up with as many uses as possible for an object, and a ""circles"" task, in which one is given a page of nickel-sized circles to draw on, and the creativity of one’s drawings is rated. All children performed similarly on a pre-test composed of these tasks. Two days later, some of the children were surprised by the return of their test booklets with either verbal feedback specifying how they could have performed better (""You wrote many short words, but not many long ones"") or a score. All of the children then engaged in slightly different versions of the same tasks. A third session two hours later repeated the original tasks, and children answered questions regarding their motivation on the tasks and the sources of their performance. An important factor to remember for the results of these experiments is that they were conducted in the children’s school classroom, in a manner reminiscent of school assignments. By sixth grade, students have learned that what one does in school is important only when there is evaluative extrinsic rewards and motivation 167 feedback. Unfortunately, university students often appear to feel the same way, visibly going on vacation when told something will not be on the exam. In keeping with this, students who had not gotten their test booklets back before the second session (no feedback) did not perform as well as the others on the later tests. They probably did not see the assignment as important and did not put in effort. Consistent with other studies, the two different kinds of feedback led to differences in performance on the open-ended tasks (not on the fixedsolution ones). For example, students who received verbal feedback about how to do better thought of more uses for objects later than did students who had received grades. In addition, students who received comments reported higher levels of motivation on and more liking for the tasks than did those who received grades. What was new about this study was that grades and comments also had different impacts on what the students felt contributed to their performance: their theories of intelligence. Students who received comments attributed their performance to effort, interest, and skill, whereas students who received grades were more apt to attribute their performance to the reader’s mood: an external, uncontrollable variable. If one has an incremental theory, skill is something one can control. The reader’s mood, on the other hand, is outside one’s control. The literature on learned helplessness and issues discussed in chapter 3 arise. As was discussed there, entity theorists tend to feel helpless in the face of failure. Attributions of effort aligned with these different perceptions of what underlay their performance. Students in the grades group attributed their effort to a desire to avoid failure, whereas those who received comments attributed their effort to their interest in the task. The entity theorists’ performance goals are thus apparent in the group who received grades. Grades and other evaluations, then, undermine motivation perhaps in part because they tend to lead to performance goals instead of mastery ones. Grades appear to lead children to view their level of performance as reflecting their being smart or dumb, not as indicative of having studied hard or not.",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,

For the abstract group, all of the instruction examples were presented with general referents (""solid, liquid"") without any meaningful background theme. For example, one item read, ""There are three objects. Each is cut in one-half. In all, how many pieces would there be?"" (p. 73). The concrete group received hypothetical but concrete referents, for example stating that Bill had three candy bars, each of which he cut in half. The third group had examples that were intended to be most interesting, because they were personalized to concern matters of subjective importance, such as one’s birthday, teachers and friends, hobbies, and so on. For example, their teacher (mentioned by name) presented them with three Mars bars (their favorite candy) on their birthday, and if they cut each candy bar in half, how many friends could they share with? As bookends to these lessons, children took pre- and post-tests of their understanding of fractions. The results were clear in supporting that children learn best when the material is of personal interest. On the post-test, the abstract group scored lowest (averaging 2 of 11 problems correct), the concrete next-lowest (3.5 of 11), and the personalized group had the highest score (6 of 11).

Children in the control condition saw the game in an unembellished, rather banal format, with the title of ‘Math Game.’ For the other children, the game was presented within a spaceship fantasy context and either had the title ‘Space Quest’ and involved the child imagining she or he was piloting a spaceship to other planets to save Earth from an energy crisis, or else had the title ‘Treasure Hunt,’ and involved imagining he or she was the captain of a ship seeking buried treasure. Some children also had personalized games that began with the child’s name (‘Best of luck in your journey, Commander Christy’) and sent the child off on the journey with his or her own personal favorite foods. Children played these games three times at school over a two-week period, for 30 minutes each time. A week later they were tested on their knowledge of the use of parentheses in arithmetic expressions as well as their knowledge of arithmetic operations in a different context. Their enjoyment of the game, their own assessment of their performance, and their desired level of challenge in future games were also assessed. The results were quite clear. When interesting contexts had been provided, children showed better knowledge of how parentheses affect arithmetic operations and were better able to transfer that knowledge to non-computer contexts. Personalization augmented these effects. In addition, students’ motivation was clearly influenced by the manipulation. Students in the context conditions were much more likely to opt for the computer playing its best game, liked the game more, were more willing to stay after school to play the game, believed themselves to be better at the games, and indicated they would seek a more challenging game later.

excerpt_913,"In the first experiment, children were given three sets of problems to solve. The first set was a moderately difficult one, so all the children did fairly well. At that point, all of the children were told, “Wow, you did very well on these problems.” No matter how they had actually done, all the children were told they had gotten 80% right. “That’s a really high score.” (Children were “debriefed” about the experiment later.) Then, roughly a third of the children were told, “You must be smart at these problems,” in effect giving them an entity or fixed-trait reason for their high score. A different third were told, “You must have worked hard at these problems,” implying an incremental theory of intelligence. The remaining children received no additional feedback. Presumably these children retain their native theory of intelligence, which in the general population is about 43% incremental and about 43% entity. (The rest do not fit clearly into either pattern.) Next, children were told they could do more problems, and were asked to choose what kind of problems they would like, as a measure of their achievement orientation. They were offered a choice of “Problems that aren’t too hard, so I don’t get many wrong,” “Problems that are pretty easy, so I’ll do well,” or “Problems that I’m pretty good at, so I can show that I’m smart” (p. 35). These first three options endorse performance goals and go along with an entity theory, spawning a desire to perform well in order to look intelligent. A fourth option endorsed a learning goal and thus an incremental theory: “Problems that I’ll learn a lot from even if I won’t look so smart.” After stating their preferred choice, children went on to instead do a second, more difficult set of problems that they were told the experimenter had previously chosen. Their own choices would be granted, the experimenter told them, if there was extra time at the end of the session. After completing the second set of problems, they were told they had performed a lot worse on it than on the first set. To check for the impact of the different kinds of success attribution feedback on response to this failure experience, children were next asked about their desire to take some more problems home with them, their enjoyment of the task, their perceptions about how they had done, and their attributions for how they had done. They were then given a third set of problems, which was moderately difficult, like the first set, to allow for an assessment of how the experimental intervention influenced performance. After this final task, all children were debriefed and told the second set of problems was much harder than the first, and was in fact designed for seventh-graders. The researchers ensured that all children felt proud of their performance before leaving the experiment. The results of this study are extremely interesting in terms of their implications for how rapidly children respond to feedback endorsing an entity or an incremental view. Regarding achievement motivation, 92% of the children who had received effort praise chose the learning goal after the first set of problems, by asking to receive additional problems that they would learn from. By comparison, just 8% of the children who had received the intelligence praise chose this option. The other 92% of the children who had received intelligence praise opted for problems that would be easy so they could look smart or do well.

In terms of persistence, children praised for effort were more likely to want to take some additional problems home. Finally, performance on the third set of problems was also influenced by the intervention feedback after the first set. Children praised for effort did better on the third set of problems than they had on the first set, and children praised for intelligence performed worse. Children who had received no praise showed no change. Thus a single sentence of feedback attributing success to intelligence or effort was associated with a cascade of remarkably different reactions to a subsequent failure event. In five subsequent experiments, the researchers replicated and extended these basic findings. When people with an entity view of intelligence (enduring or induced by feedback) face failure, they attribute the failure to a fixed quality of the self. In the context of such an attribution, people avoid further challenge, instead seeking evidence that they are indeed smart. If brief experimenter feedback can have such a large impact on children, parent and teacher feedback, which continues over time and comes from people who are very important to a child, would be expected to have even more. As was discussed in chapter 5, even when teachers simply told children a test would show “how good you are in relation to other children your age,” children’s performance declined (Graham & Golan, 1991).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_915,"The studies just described show that a feedback event (or a short series of such events) can influence immediate reactions even in very young children. But mastery-oriented and helpless styles are not only temporary states of reaction to recent feedback. In the absence of particular feedback manipulations, children’s responses to challenging situations has been shown to remain stable from kindergarten until fifth grade (Ziegert, Kistner, Castro, & Robertson, 2001), and there is no reason to believe they change thereafter. The research suggests that how adults talk to children about their accomplishments has a host of important consequences. Dweck (1999) describes many other interesting outcomes and considerations regarding these two theories of self as malleable or fixed. The fact that adult feedback appears to push children toward adopting one or the other such view is what is important to the ideas of this chapter. Adult feedback that endorses a malleable view of intelligence is clearly better for children.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_916,"Consistent with Dweck’s findings, Dr. Montessori was against using any sort of entity evaluation of a child, positive or negative. “To tell a person he is clever or clumsy, bright or stupid, good or bad, is a form of betrayal. The child must see for himself what he can do, and it is important to give him not only the means of education but also to supply him with indicators which tell him his mistakes. . . . The child’s interest [is] in doing better.” (1967a, p. 250)",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_917,"Condoning a mastery approach to the mistakes one makes, Dr. Montessori advised that “it is well to cultivate a friendly feeling towards error, to treat it as a companion inseparable from our lives, as something having a purpose, which it truly has” (1967a, p. 246). Teachers were advised to have this sense about themselves, and to pass this sense on to children. An attitude that mistakes are valuable because we can learn from them is consistent with a mastery approach to learning and with an incremental theory of intelligence.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_918,"Not correcting children’s work was part of this incremental approach. Dr. Montessori held that children naturally correct their mistakes when they can perceive those mistakes, just as a baby corrects his or her own mistakes in learning to walk. A child learns through repetition of exercises where the mistakes are obvious, she claimed, not from an adult’s correcting his or her work. “What is meant by correcting exercise books? It means marking them from 0 to 10. How can a zero correct anyone’s defects?” (1967a, p. 245). Instead, Dr. Montessori counseled that correction comes from the child’s own observation of his mistakes in the outcome, and that the materials the child works with should make it obvious to the child when he has erred (see the discussion in chapter 5 on the Control of Error).",Montessori,Academic/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_919,"In this way the adult avoids passing judgment on the child and thus inadvertently promoting the performance goal of looking good for the adult. Having children find their own errors through the materials and work to master materials for their own sakes would be expected to lead to (or preserve) a mastery orientation in Montessori children. Dr. Montessori clearly valued intrinsic over performance reasons for one’s work: “If work comes from an inner source, it is much more intense and much more fruitful” (1989, p. 85). Whether Montessori children do have more of a mastery orientation toward schoolwork than do children in traditional school situations is a question for empirical study. Children in other nontraditional school systems clearly do (for example, Boaler, 1997; Boaler & Staples, 2003). Regardless, in counseling teachers never to give entity praise or criticism to children, Dr. Montessori’s recommendations for teachers are consistent with what self-theories research suggests will produce the most optimal child outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Physically, it may well be necessary, because children are asked to sit and listen much of the time and sitting still can be tiring, even sometimes for adults.

In addition, when a child needs a break from work in Montessori, the child can take it. Children can stop and daydream for a time, pick up a recreational book, engage in free drawing, perhaps go outside and play, and so on. Of course, children are not free to abandon their education, and the teacher is responsible for noticing if a child is not using time wisely and intervening if needed. But children are free to make such choices as long as they behave responsibly, and thus the mental-break function of recess may be unnecessary in Montessori.",Montessori,Social,Example,excerpt,The Impact of Movement on Learning and Cognition,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_924,"To the extent that children might interact with other children in traditional schooling arrangements, those others are usually of about the same age and ability. One might say that children are grouped in narrow bands. The first band is by age level: most of the children in the classroom are born within one year of each other, with a set birth date as the cut-off for being part of a classroom. Within each classroom, in many schools children are also grouped by ability level for each subject (“tracked”). By learning in this manner, children are removed from other children who are at very different levels. Their learning occurs in a narrow ability band. This is convenient to a factory model, since factories operate most efficiently if all of the raw materials are uniform. It suits the Lockean model of the child as well, since children at the same level are assumed to be alike and thus ready for the same knowledge to be poured in.",Traditional,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_925,"To examine this, researchers exposed toddlers to either a female adult or a 3-year-boy performing a variety of actions (Ryalls, Gul, & Ryalls, 2000). While sitting on their mothers’ laps, the children observed the model performing action sequences such as inserting a ball into a plastic egg, closing the egg, and shaking it. To see if they imitated the model’s actions, children were given the objects immediately and again after a one-week delay. Regardless of the delay time, children who had seen a slightly older peer model replicated a greater number of complex action sequences than did children exposed to an adult model, suggesting the peer elicited more imitation. This is a fascinating finding in need of replication. Because only one model was used for each condition, it is possible that some other difference in the models besides their peer/adult status was responsible for the result. We know, for example, that people are particularly apt to imitate those with whom they have better rapport (Bernieri, 1988), and perhaps children felt more rapport with the child for reasons other than age. More research is needed on this issue, using several different peer and adult models, but the finding is intriguing.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_926,"Montessori encourages learning from peers in part by using three-year age groupings. This ensures that as children move through the classroom they will be exposed to older and younger peers, facilitating both imitative learning and peer tutoring (discussed later). Dr. Montessori was quite clear about the need for this mix of ages: “The main thing is that the groups should contain different ages. . . . To have success you must have these different ages. . . . The older children are interested in the younger, and the younger in the older” (Montessori, 1989, pp. 68–69). A child enters the Primary classroom at 21 ⁄2 or 3 years of age and remains there until he or she has completed the “cycle of materials,” the full set of materials Dr. Montessori determined was optimal for a Primary classroom.

According to attachment theory, children need a close adult who will function as a secure base from which to explore the world and a safe haven to which to retreat in times of stress. The psychologist Mary Ainsworth (1967), Bowlby’s colleague, moved the attachment construct from the theoretical to the empirical realm by establishing a method to assess attachment. Her method has been very important to our understanding of child development because it allows us to make reliable long-term predictions of child outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_934,"The paradigm Ainsworth devised to measure attachment is called the Strange Situation. The infant, usually between 12 and 18 months of age (the test may not be valid outside of that age range), is brought into a room full of toys with his or her mother. Over the next 15 or 20 minutes, the mother and a stranger come and go in a series of prearranged episodes. At one point the child is alone with the toys, then the door opens and in walks not the mother but the stranger. This is often very upsetting to the child, who usually already appeared stressed over being left alone. A moment later the mother returns, and the behavior of the child during this reunion is particularly diagnostic for attachment classification.",Traditional,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_937,"As stated, long-term outcome studies favor the secure attachment style. For example, in one study, children whose attachment status had been classified when they were infants returned to the laboratory at 2 years of age to engage in some problem-solving tasks with their mothers. Children previously rated as securely attached were more competent problem solvers, were more persistent, showed more enthusiasm, and were also more compliant with their mothers (Matas, Arend, & Sroufe, 1978).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

When children were told they were not doing well in the game, securely attached children upped their efforts, whereas insecurely attached children decreased their efforts.

For this measure, the child’s teacher or some other trained observer sorts preselected statements concerning a child’s possible profile into piles indicating whether the statements are more or less characteristic of the child. The statements are about such issues as how the child responds to fearful situations, the child’s predominant mood, and how often the child seeks proximity and comfort. Sort patterns are used to place children into the different attachment style categories, and these categories correspond closely with attachment classifications from the Strange Situation months or years earlier, and predict a similar range of developmental outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Responses on this interview tend to be related to the interaction style of one’s current relationships (Treboux, Crowell, & Waters, 2004), to parenting behaviors (Adam, Gunnar, & Tanaka, 2004), and to one’s attachment classification as an infant. In one study, people who were tested in the Strange Situation as infants and as adults found that 72% of participants were classified with the convergent attachment styles at both time points (Waters, Merrick, Treboux, Crowell, & Albersheim, 2000). Thus, attachment is an enduring construct, applicable even beyond infancy.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_943,"Given the importance of the construct to predicting later competence and well-being, a pertinent question is what leads a child to have a particular type of relationship with the caregiver. Bowlby (1969) and Ainsworth (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) believed that an important antecedent factor in attachment style was adult sensitivity, and research has borne out that possibility (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Discussion following refers to maternal sensitivity because that was Ainsworth’s main concern, but the constructs seem to apply to any close caregiver. Important attachment relationships also of course develop with fathers (Grossmann et al., 2002), and they also appear to develop with day-care providers and teachers. Children growing up on Israeli kibbutzim become attached to their caregivers, and the quality of those relationships also predicts children’s outcomes (Oppenheim, Sagi, & Lamb, 1988). Children with a secure attachment to their kibbutz caregiver were later more goal directed and achievement oriented than were other children. This is consistent with work showing that American children’s relationships with their kindergarten teachers are related to their academic and behavioral outcomes through eighth grade (Hamre & Pianta, 2001).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_944,"Awareness requires that the mother be proximate to the infant so that she can perceive the infant’s signals. This aspect of attachment theory led to a concern beginning in the 1970s about whether babies placed in day care could become attached to their mothers. After many years of controversy, the recent National Study of Day Care, involving a representative sample of over 1,000 American children in a variety of day-care arrangements, has shown that use of day care has no significant impact on child-mother attachment relations (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). It is the mother’s awareness of signals when she is with the infant that appears to matter, and not that she is with the infant at all times. One might revise Ainsworth’s criteria for awareness, then, to read that the adult must be proximate to the infant for some reasonable amount of time, and when proximate, must be able to perceive the infant’s signals. A second aspect of awareness, besides proximity, is having a low perceiving threshold. The adult must notice the child’s signals.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_945,"The second major aspect of sensitivity for Ainsworth is accurate interpretation. Adults must interpret the babies’ signals for what they are, rather than distorting the signals in some way. Distortions could be caused by adults projecting their own needs on the infant, denying the infant’s needs because of their own needs, or any other biasing of the infant’s signals to accord with the adult’s own wishes and needs. Ainsworth noted that to overcome such proclivities, the adult must have self-insight. A second feature necessary to accurate interpretation, according to Ainsworth, is empathy. Adults who lack empathy, she said, would have detached, intellectual relations with babies instead of warm, sensitive ones. “A mother might be quite aware of and understand accurately the baby’s behavior and the circumstances leading to her baby’s distress or demands, but because she is unable to empathize with him -- unable to see things from the baby’s point to view--she may tease him back into good humor, mock him, laugh at him, or just ignore him” (Ainsworth, 1969, p. 2). Lack of empathy thus leads to inappropriate response.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_946,"Even correctly interpreted signals can be followed by inappropriate responses. The third main feature of sensitivity for Ainsworth is that the response to the perceived and accurately interpreted signal be an appropriate one. Ainsworth noted that in the first year, the appropriate response to the baby is almost always what the child “asks” for via his or her signals: pick the child up when the signal indicates a desire to be held, feed the child when the signal indicates hunger, and so on. After the first year, Ainsworth noted that doing exactly as the baby asks is no longer always the best response. As they get older, children increasingly need to adapt to the world, rather than always expecting the world to adapt to them. On the other hand, children also need to feel some sense of control or efficacy, as suggested by the research presented in chapter 3. Ainsworth advised that thebest response after age 1 is a compromise response that keeps the child’s long-range interests at heart.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_947,The final feature of sensitivity concerns timing of the response. Ainsworth noted that responses must be prompt to be effective. Adults who were devoted to a rigid feed or sleep schedule would be insensitive on this point. Responses need to be timed closely after the baby’s calls for attention for the baby to experience the efficacy of his or her actions.,Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_948,"Ainsworth’s theoretical ideas regarding sensitivity were compiled into a rating scale on which the sensitivity of primary caregivers to their children could be scored by trained observers watching mothers and children interact. Ainsworth’s original study of 23 mother-child pairs found a remarkably strong relationship between maternal sensitivity and child attachment classification (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Many studies have been done in the meantime, and the results are not as strong; some even fail to show a relationship. When results are inconsistent, the best response is a meta-analysis combining results across many studies. A recent meta-analysis of maternal sensitivity and attachment shows there is a relationship between the two factors, such that (in statistical terms) a child’s chances of being securely attached move from 38% if a mother is not sensitive to 62% if the mother is sensitive (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Because all scales and measures are prone to some degree of “measurement error,” the relationship in real terms might be stronger.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_949,"The issue of direction of effects naturally arises here. Perhaps the reason some mothers respond sensitively has to do with characteristics of the infant, and those infant characteristics lead to the later positive outcomes. In this view, the mother has no direct bearing on the child’s later outcomes. The obvious infant characteristic to consider is the child’s personality (or temperament), and studies have been done examining the relationship between child personality and attachment security (Vaughn & Bost, 1999). The upshot of these studies is that although personality predicts some aspects of behavior in the Strange Situation, it does not predict reunion behaviors, which are the most diagnostic of relationship quality.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_950,"One could still argue, however, that some aspect of the child is responsible for attachment classification. Experimental designs can address this. In fact, several intervention studies have been conducted, in which mothers were trained to respond more sensitively to their infants and changes in attachment classification following the intervention were examined. A recent meta-analysis of 88 intervention studies showed that short, focused interventions related to maternal sensitivity were effective both in making parents respond more sensitively to their infants and in changing infant attachment status (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van Ijzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). Such work strongly suggests that maternal sensitivity has a causal relationship to attachment classification.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_951,"Ainsworth’s rating scales were designed for observation of mothers with their infants. But a mother’s interaction style with a child evolves over time. Other research has looked at how parents of securely attached infants behave toward them somewhat later, as toddlers and preschoolers. One can view this as addressing how the sensitive pattern of responding adapts as children age. Mothers whose children were insecurely attached as infants tend to interact more intrusively with them in first and second grades (Egeland, Pianta, & O’Brien, 1993). Their interaction styles are more directive, such that they are more apt to tell their children exactly what to do. In contrast, parents of securely attached children tend not simply to tell the children what to do, but instead make suggestions, helping children to figure things out for themselves (Fagot, Gauvain, & Kavanagh, 1996; Frankel & Bates, 1990; Matas et al., 1978; Moss, 1992). They are closely involved, but nonintrusive. In Bruner’s (1975) terms, echoing Vygotsky, parents of securely attached children provide ideal scaffolds for children, structuring the environment such that children can internalize problem-solving strategies (see also Gauvain, 2001), whereas parents of insecurely attached children are more directive.

excerpt_952,"Dr. Montessori advised that teachers show a degree of warmth and sensitivity that is reminiscent of the characteristics of parents whose children are securely attached. The focal period for forming attachment relationships (12 to 18 months) is of course usually prior to the age of entry into a Montessori classroom. Yet there is nothing to indicate that the adult behaviors associated with particular attachment styles cease to matter, and indeed those behaviors are consistent with literature suggesting optimal parenting practices for older children as well.

Indeed, Dr. Montessori (1917/1965) said, “The fundamental quality [teachers must possess was] a capacity for observation” (p. 130). Like the sensitive parents described by Ainsworth (1969), teachers’ thresholds for perceiving signals should be low. They should be trained to notice and correctly interpret the behavioral manifestations of the child’s inner state, in order to know what to do next. As is discussed later in the chapter with regard to teacher training, Dr. Montessori also advised teachers to develop self-understanding, so they do not misinterpret children’s signals in ways that align with their own needs.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_955,"When children are concentrating on work, Dr. Montessori held that they should be left alone, because during such moments, she believed, they are developing themselves. In chapter 3, I discussed the idea that concentration might be an engine of self-regulation, which is associated with many positive personality variables. Dr. Montessori saw concentration as the moment of self-development. Because of this theoretical stance, she held that teachers must watch for any concentrated purposeful movement, so as to let it go undisturbed; the child must be protected from stimuli that would break the concentration. For example, Dr. Montessori described an incident in which a child who had thus far been disorderly in school one day began to rearrange the furniture, with an expression of intense interest. The teacher was inclined to stop him, but Dr. Montessori saw his activity as coordinated toward a useful end, and manifesting that child’s first moments of concentration on purposeful activity in the classroom. According to Dr. Montessori, a sensitive teacher would leave a child alone in such actions, as long as the child was not disturbing others.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_956,"The Montessori teacher must also be sensitive to when the child is ready for something new, because “the brain always asks for work which becomes more complex” (Montessori, 1989, p. 89). After great concentration a child may need to rest or simply observe others (Montessori, 1989, p. 19), but at a certain point the child will be ready for more complex work. The teacher must be attuned to such moments, and give the child new work when the child is ready. Further, like parents of securely attached children in problem-solving situations, the Montessori teacher must structure the environment in such a way that children can make discoveries on their own.

Thorndike’s recommendation for how a teacher should give instructions, for example, was to say, “Do the work on this page. Do it again, keeping track of how many minutes you spend. Practice again until you can get all the answers right in 12 minutes” (Thorndike, 1921b, p. 17). Communication was to be simple, direct, and dry.

Books at such an early age were deemed harmful by several of Montessori’s contemporaries.

If children can imagine fairy tales, she wrote, why not ask them to imagine parts of the real earth that they cannot see? Children apparently surprised her repeatedly by showing interest in real activities over play, and she responded by creating an educational system that expects maturity, as do authoritative parents. This can put people off, because they see Montessori education as not being sufficiently fun. Empirical research should more directly address this issue, but the Middle School study mentioned previously (Rathunde & Csikszentmihalyi, in press) and other work concerning children’s motivation and affect when engaged in Montessori-like practices (collaborative learning, lack of extrinsic rewards, and so) in traditional settings suggest that it is probably not a concern. Children do appear to enjoy learning in the circumstances of Montessori classrooms.",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_983,"As was discussed earlier, Dr. Montessori advised that adults show great emotional warmth when dealing with children. Children must have “a teacher who looks on them with love and hope” (Montessori, 1989, p. 79). Yet at the same time, the adult’s ultimate control of the environment was clearly a high priority. The pitfalls of permissive adult attitudes were pointed out in her writing. “If freedom is understood as letting the children do as they like, using or more likely misusing, the things available, it is clear that only their ‘deviations’ are free to develop” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 206). Permissive parents are often thought of as ones who want to be their children’s friends; it is hard for them to exercise authority. Dr. Montessori saw the dangers in this: “The teacher must be superior and not just a friend. . . . [Children] need a dignified, mature person. . . . If they have no authority, they have no directive. Children need this support” (1989, p. 17). Some Montessori teachers, like some parents, err in this regard. They do not provide ultimate control over the environment, deal effectively with unproductive behaviors, or guide children’s decisions in positive ways. Freedom can thus be taken to an extreme, and Dr. Montessori counseled against this repeatedly. “One time I saw an entire class of disorganized children who were using the materials completely wrongly. The teacher drifted about in the class, silent as the Sphinx. . . . This teacher was committing a grave error: She feared disturbing their disorder, instead of attempting to establish the order” (Montessori, 1956, p. 140).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_984,"Another not uncommon error in Montessori teaching is the opposite one: for teachers to be overly rigid about the method, in a manner reminiscent of authoritarian parents. Dr. Montessori also spoke against an authoritarian stance: “The teacher can address the pupil energetically and severely and thus jolt him out of his behavior, but those who know their jobs well have means more effective than coercion for recalling the pupil to order” (1956, p. 141). Authoritarian parents tell children to do things because the parent says so; they do not reason with the child, and they appear to take on a stance that they are infallible. Yet adults who work with children have to admit to being fallible (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246). Education, she said, was traditionally “directed toward the suppression or bending of the child’s will, and the substitution for it of the teacher’s will, which demands from the child unquestioning obedience” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 252). Against the behaviorist trend, she said, “We cannot directly mold. . . . individual forms of character, intelligence, and feeling” (1917/1965, p. 9).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

They should provide an appropriately structured environment in which children are free to make their own decisions and discoveries.

Still, my guess is that a new class of children in the same school would not strongly affect a teacher’s responses and that teachers were the main causal factor in children’s responses. In addition, in chapter 3 I mentioned a study in which teachers were trained to give children more control in the classroom, and positive changes were observed in their students (De Charms, 1976).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

In one study, when teachers were told their students would have to pass specific educational standards, teachers became more controlling, talked and commanded more, gave students less choice and autonomy, and expressed more criticism of students (Deci, Spiefel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kaufman, 1982). Both as children get older, and when standardized testing is emphasized, teachers in traditional schools become more prone to create classroom environments that are at odds with more optimal child outcomes. In the context of traditional education, teachers can attempt to overcome the negative effects of grades and testing, and the inherently competitive, comparative system they create. The system, however, was designed for their use, and as the current enthusiasm for high-stakes testing shows, as a culture we keep returning to it.

The Montessori teacher’s goal is clearly the child’s self-regulation; the teacher’s task was well done when the teacher was needed only to give additional lessons. “Any pedagogical action, if it is to be efficacious in the training of little children, must tend to help the children to advance upon this road of independence” (Montessori, 1912/1964, p. 97).

Before concentration occurs, the directress may do more or less what she thinks best; she may interfere with the children’s activities as much as she thinks necessary” (1967a, p. 278).

She recommended doing so by redirection rather than punishment. “Interfere by all means to stop disturbances, but we need not punish or scold or admonish when we stop bad behavior; we can ask the child to come and pick flowers in the garden or offer a toy or any occupation that will appeal to [the child]” (Montessori, 1989, p. 16).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_1002,"An ability to observe children and detect their needs is fundamental to good Montessori teaching. Dr. Montessori maintained that the capacity to observe children has to be carefully developed through long practice (1917/1965, p. 130). In the AMI Montessori teacher training courses, scores of hours are spent with children, observing their actions, recording those observations, and crafting them into reports to be reviewed by the teacher trainer. Dr. Montessori advocated training in science, rather than in education, for people who would go into Montessori teaching, in part because training in science is training in close observation (Montessori, 1917/1965, p. 138). She was also concerned that training in traditional education might make it more difficult to become a good Montessori teacher. “An ordinary teacher cannot be transformed into a Montessori teacher, but must be created anew, having rid herself of pedagogical prejudices” (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 87).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

This emphasis on one’s personal preparation to be a teacher contrasts sharply with traditional teacher training, which focuses more on how one does things than on one’s own psychology.

The knowledge in these albums is of course not as deep and thorough as that of the teacher trainer, just as the notes of a student taking a college course would not reflect all the knowledge of the professor, but they are sufficiently thorough to allow the teacher to refer to them over the coming years, and to guide his or her lessons in the future. Some other Montessori teacher training courses routinely give teachers copies of the information rather than having them write and illustrate it themselves.

However, when explicitly told to use the military problem information in solving the medical problem, 90% were able to solve it.

Others were told only to work as fast as they could, and yet others were not given any information about working fast or completing by a certain time. All participants actually completed the games in the allotted time, confirming that the deadline was a comfortable one. Interest in the game was measured both by how much time participants spent on it during a later free period and by their answers on a quesionnaire about their interest. Students who had been told to work fast and students with no deadline spent over half of their free time in the subsequent period continuing to play AdLib, whereas students in both deadline conditions spent less than a third of their time playing it. Given free choice, then, those with deadlines were simply not as interested in the game later as those who had played it earlier without deadlines.

For the Spindle Box (chapter 2), if a child counts incorrectly for one slot, the error should become apparent when the numbers fail to work out for subsequent slots. Likewise, when the child builds the Pink Tower, described in chapter 2, if the child skips a block in the sequence, later the child will be confronted with a block that is larger than the one under it.

If children could read the name on a card, she promised, they could play with the toy as a reward. Like many adults, she assumed rewards were positive and even necessary to get children to engage in difficult tasks. The children, however, showed her differently. They eagerly read the words, but showed no interest in the toys, asking instead for another word to read. This suggested to her that a challenging activity, reading (for new readers), could be motivating in and of itself. The extrinsic reward of playing with a toy was not valued, and in fact seemed an undesired distraction from their real mission.

The structural organization involved was a diorama of a miniature town, into which 20 small items, including animals, cars, people, and so on, were logically placed while the children, Maya and American 8- and 9-year-olds, looked on. The 20 objects were then replaced into the pool of 80 items from which they were drawn, and the children were asked to reconstruct the scene. Although the Maya sample had shown much poorer memory previously on a standard list task, their performance was even slightly better than that of the American children in this organized task. Although children learn to memorize lists of unrelated items in Traditional schools, one might question whether this is a good use of their processing resources.Transitive inference tasks are ones in which one learns that A > B and B > C, and one must infer that A > C.

When the child did not see the object under the first pillow, the child gave up. Piaget then showed the child how he had moved the object, and repeated the procedure. The child behaved in exactly the same way, whereupon Piaget lifted the second pillow and asked, ""Didn’t you see I put it here?"" (on the prior hiding trial). ""Yes,"" his child replied, ""but it should be there"" (pointing to the first pillow) (Montessori, 1966, pp. 53–54). Although to Piaget this task was probably about inference, to Dr. Montessori the incident was about the child’s need to find the object in its proper place. She also noted that children often play hide-and-seek by hiding in the same place over and over, or in the place where the last hider was just found.

Everyone looked admiringly at ‘the writer,’ and thus they felt moved to follow his example. ‘I can do it too!’ they cried.

Other 4-year-olds, having also been indirectly prepared to write through the use of knobs on Wooden Cylinders and other materials, pencils in Metal Insets, and so on, as was described in chapter 1, spontaneously began writing in reaction to having observed a first child reaching that landmark. Obviously children also see others learn to write in traditional schools; what is unique in Montessori is the series of steps, all visible and imitable, that lead children along the path to writing, so that a community of 4-year-olds can discover they already have the ability to write once they see it done by another child.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

In classrooms that used the tutoring program, the tutoring process described earlier replaced some in-class spelling work. Over the two years of the study, children in the peer tutoring classrooms were spelling 87% of the words correctly on average, whereas children in other classrooms were spelling 75% of words correctly. This is not an enormous difference, but it is certainly a meaningful one.

In addition, they apparently benefit learning other topics and over the long term",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1184,"In one demonstration of these benefits, a follow-up study expanded the peer tutoring to cover reading, math, and language, and examined children’s performance over multiple years. Children in the tutoring program performed significantly better than those in the control group on all three topics both immediately and two years later, when they had moved on to middle school and no longer had the program. They also performed better in two nontutored topics: science and social studies. They even performed as well as children in a higher SES group in all these areas (Greenwood et al., 1989). In addition, fewer children from the peer tutoring group were placed in special-education classes (Greenwood, Terry, Utley, Montagna, & Walker, 1993). This study is among many suggesting that peer tutoring programs, appropriately structured, improve learning in traditional schools and that the benefits extend across time and topics (see Topping & Ehly, 1998).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1185,"Peer tutoring programs vary in terms of how structured each tutoring session is, and more structured programs are typically associated with greater success. Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) is an example of a more structured tutoring program (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998), and it has also been used to examine the effect of rewards. RPT begins with training sessions about teamwork and cooperation, and children are told they can win rewards by using teamwork. In the RPT program, teaching aides show the children how to tutor each other. Then RPT sessions are held twice weekly for 45 minutes each. Special flash-card materials are used, with a problem on one side and steps to the solution on the other. Children decide who will be tutor first in each session, and work for 10 minutes on problems before switching roles. After the initial 20 minutes, problem drill sheets are administered, and students attempt the problems, then switch papers with partners for correction. Performance on the drill sheets accrues points, which lead to such rewards as being teacher’s helper or working on a special project. When children were randomly assigned to RPT versus traditional instruction groups, those in the RPT groups consistently showed higher levels of mathematics achievement (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998). Two alternative groups were also formed, one with the reward but lacking the structure provided by the flash cards, and the other having the structure but no reward. The combination of rewards and structure led to the most gains in both achievement and positive social behavior. Structure alone, without rewards, was associated with better behavior both in the tutoring sessions and in the regular classroom situation. Students also perceived themselves to be more competent when using structured than when using unstructured tutoring, but achievement was not improved in the absence of rewards (Fantuzzo, King, & Heller, 1992). Thus, within a traditional school environment, more structured peer interactions with a reward structure optimized learning and behavior. The issue of rewards is important and is discussed further in the context of collaborative learning.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1186,"Although supplementing whole-class teaching with peer tutoring improves achievement, adults are even more effective tutors than peers. The research suggests several reasons for this that shed light on how peer tutoring can be most effective. First, adults structure the task in ways that keep the overarching goal in clear focus, whereas child partners tend to focus on parts of the problem, losing sight of the whole--a difference reminiscent of the differences between same-age experts and novices. For example, if the task is planning a route for doing a set of errands as efficiently as possible, child pairs will get the errands done, but not as efficiently, because they focus on each individual item to be retrieved separately, rather than thinking about how several items can be grouped to make for more efficient routes. Adult tutors get children to think about grouping items. However, when the peer tutor is trained in this task and taught to consider how to group items, tutee performance does improve. Nonetheless, performance even with a trained peer tutor does not improve to the level obtained when the tutor was an adult (Gauvain, 2001).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1187,"A second probable reason for the greater success of adult tutors is that adults tend to include children more in the task at hand. Other children can become autocratic, as children are inclined to focus on who gets to do what. Children tend to like to do; adults more easily sit back, watch, and guide. Research has shown that peer learning is also more successful when peers listen to each other and question each other more (reviewed below), skills that many adults have but many children have not yet learned (Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1188,"Perhaps in part because peer tutors can become autocratic, some research suggests that, when tutored by a peer, the tutee benefits maximally from a peer who is just a bit more advanced rather than much more advanced. For example, research on both scientific and moral reasoning has shown that children benefit from exposure to thought processes that are just above their current level (Damon & Killen, 1982; Kuhn, 1972; Turiel & Rothman, 1972)",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1189,"Besides being less able to adapt to a lower level of tutee, much older and more advanced peer tutors sometimes practice social dominance. The problems of autocracy mentioned earlier thus become exacerbated, and the tutee learns less, because he or she is less involved in the decision-making process. This was found in a study in which 5-year-old novices were paired either with 5- or 7-year-olds who were considered experts at planning routes (as in the study just described) (Duran & Gauvain, 1993). Children were more involved with the task when paired with an advanced planner of their own age, as opposed to an older planner, and this increased involvement predicted better performance. Whether the particular age gap used in this experiment (5 to 7) is a particularly problematic one would be an interesting topic for research. The age of 6 is a pivotal one, recognized in many of the world’s cultures as an appropriate time to ask more of children, such as by beginning formal schooling (Rogoff, 1981). Six is the age at which Piaget speculated children advance to being able to perform mental operations (for example, imagining addition and subtraction), and which Dr. Montessori considered transitional between her first and second planes of development. At each plane, she said, children think differently. Examining whether 6- and 8-, or 7- and 9-year-olds, make more effective tutoring pairs would be of interest. The research suggests that peers who are slightly advanced, but not too advanced, make more optimal tutors, but it might also be the case that tutors who are within particular age spans are best",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

For example, one story involved a man who needed to stack tires on a high shelf, and the solution was to stack tires to use as a step stool. After hearing the first story, children who did not solve it spontaneously (about 80% of them) were shown the solution. The second story was about a man who needed to get hay bales on a high tractor--a problem that could also be solved by stacking items. Some children were simply told the story, whereas others were asked to teach the solution to a Kermit the Frog puppet. Children who taught Kermit the Frog spontaneously came up with the solution to the second story of the pairs twice as frequently as children who were simply read the story",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_1193,"The psychologist Elliot Aronson designed the Jigsaw program initially to address the disturbances that followed the integration of public schools in Austin, Texas, in the 1960s (Aronson & Patnoe, 1997). He reasoned that close student contact, for the purpose of helping others, might alleviate problems, and so created learning arrangements that would lead to such contact. In the Jigsaw model, children are placed in groups of five or six and topics of study are broken into as many segments. For the topic of the Civil War, for example, one person might be assigned to study the history of slavery, another the type of weapons used in the era, another the major battles, 210 Montessori and so on. Children research their topic on their own, and then temporarily join a new group composed of the child from every other group in the class who was assigned their same topic. These “homogenous” groups share information and practice presentations of their topics. Finally, children reunite with their original groups, and each child teaches the material. A test on all the material generally follows. The Jigsaw method has repeatedly been found to improve learning as well as classroom social relations (Aronson, 2002; Bridgeman, 1981; Lazarowitz, Hertz-Lazarowitz, & Baird, 1994). In terms of academic achievement, it is particularly successful with minority youths, but in some cases it has improved, and in no cases (to my knowledge) has it negatively affected, the learning of other students (Lucker, Rosenfield, Sikes, & Aronson, 1977; Slavin, 1983).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

Ten- and 11-year-olds were assigned to one of four conditions, crossing “working in pairs/alone” with “encouraged to talk/not,” and asked to 212 Montessori solve puzzles, such as to determine how a spaceship moved or to decipher the effect of using a particular function key on a computer. Children who worked together and were encouraged to talk were most likely to solve the puzzles and produced the most interpretive talk. Even when children were alone and encouraged to talk to themselves, their use of interpretive talk was positively related to their ability to solve the puzzles. Descriptive talk, which is more characteristic of children in the kindergarten years, was associated with low levels of performance on the problem-solving tasks. The children who performed the worst were ones who worked alongside others but were discouraged from talking at all, which is the typical arrangement in traditional elementary schools. In contrast, children at these ages in Montessori schools tend to work together, and they frequently talk while they work. This study suggests that elementary school children particularly benefit from collaboration because by their ages children are apt to engage in the kind of discussion that advances understanding: interpretive talk. Younger children are less apt to engage in interpretive talk.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

They were asked if they would like to receive a Good Player Award, and all the children assented. They were told that all they had to do to win the award was draw with the markers. After each child had drawn for six minutes, a Good Player Award was placed with great fanfare on an ""Honor Roll Board."" For the other two conditions, children were simply allowed to draw with the markers for six minutes and then were unexpectedly given a Good Player Award, or they drew for six minutes and no award was ever mentioned. A panel of judges who were blind to what condition the children had been in rated the drawings’ creativity. Drawings done by children who expected rewards were judged as significantly lower in quality than drawings done in the other two conditions. This was the first finding. The second one was that a few weeks later, when the classroom was observed for marker use, children who had expected a reward used the markers much less than they had previously, and half as much as the other children.

Then they were told they would read a second passage, with directions that varied by condition. Some children were told, ""After you are finished, I’m going to test you on it. I want to see how much you can remember. You should work as hard as you can, because I’ll be grading you on the test to see if you’re learning well enough."" Another group of children was told, ""After you are finished, I’ll be asking you some questions similar to the ones I just asked about the other passage."" Recall that these questions were about their personal reactions to the passages. After answering the questions about interest, pressure, and difficulty for the second reading, the children were asked to recall as much of the second 160 Montessori passage as they could. To test for conceptual learning, they were also asked to write an essay on the main point of the passage. To test long-term retention, a week later, children were asked to once again recall the second passage by rote and to write an essay describing the passage’s main point. The results were highly suggestive of what expectations about getting a grade do for learning. Students who thought they would be graded rendered the passage by rote best at the first test, but had also forgotten the most a week later, making their long-term retention equal to that of the children who thought they would be questioned only about their personal reactions. At second testing, the ""personal-reaction"" children retained almost all of the rote information reported at the first session. But rote learning is usually not what we really value, after all. Conceptual learning--drawing the main point from what we read--is much more important, and the results here are compelling. The essays of the students who did not expect a test or a grade showed significantly greater conceptual learning than did the essays of the children who did expect one. The upshot is that students who expect to be tested initially learn the facts better, by rote, but as soon as the test is over, they forget much of what they learned.

Correct solutions to the first 9 problems all involved a particular pattern of use of three jugs, but a correct solution to the 10th one involved just two jugs, so the 10th problem was a set breaker: it required that the participant break a response set to consider a problem in a new way. What was of interest was not whether problems were solved correctly, since that was expected, but instead how long it took to solve them, particularly the set breaker. Whereas participants in both groups took equally long on the initial 9 items, the set-breaking 10th problem took participants in the nonreward condition only about half as long to solve as the participants who were trying for the $1 bonus.

A second opportunity to sort papers arose later, while waiting for the experimenter to find a tape recorder. During this time, other activities such as reading comic books were also available. Children’s mothers also contributed to the data by describing how they used rewards for their children’s behaviors at home and how prosocial their children were. Children in the reward condition spent significantly less time sorting paper during the second, free-choice period than did children who did not receive a reward. Therefore motivation to subsequently engage in prosocial acts was negatively impacted by a prior expected reward. A particularly interesting finding is the relationship between mothers’ habitual use of rewards and children’s responses. Children whose mothers reported that they liked and used extrinsic rewards at home were most affected by the reward manipulation. They sorted significantly less paper, on average, and fewer than half of them sorted any paper at all at the second opportunity. Children whose mothers did not use rewards at home were much less impacted by rewards, and 85% of them helped by sorting paper. Finally, it was also reported that the children of mothers who felt positively about the use of extrinsic incentives for prosocial behavior engaged in less prosocial behavior at home than did the children of the other mothers.",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,

The children who were most likely to engage spontaneously in prosocial acts were those whose mothers were least likely to respond after such acts.

excerpt_1230,"One interesting study examined the impact of grades on self theories, goals, and performance in sixth-graders using tasks with both fixed and open-ended solutions (Butler & Nisan, 1986). Some of the fixed-solution tests were word games, such as making as many words as possible from the letters of a long word and constructing new words using the first and last letters of a prior word. The open-ended tasks included a ""creative uses"" task in which one comes up with as many uses as possible for an object, and a ""circles"" task, in which one is given a page of nickel-sized circles to draw on, and the creativity of one’s drawings is rated. All children performed similarly on a pre-test composed of these tasks. Two days later, some of the children were surprised by the return of their test booklets with either verbal feedback specifying how they could have performed better (""You wrote many short words, but not many long ones"") or a score. All of the children then engaged in slightly different versions of the same tasks. A third session two hours later repeated the original tasks, and children answered questions regarding their motivation on the tasks and the sources of their performance. An important factor to remember for the results of these experiments is that they were conducted in the children’s school classroom, in a manner reminiscent of school assignments. By sixth grade, students have learned that what one does in school is important only when there is evaluative extrinsic rewards and motivation 167 feedback. Unfortunately, university students often appear to feel the same way, visibly going on vacation when told something will not be on the exam. In keeping with this, students who had not gotten their test booklets back before the second session (no feedback) did not perform as well as the others on the later tests. They probably did not see the assignment as important and did not put in effort. Consistent with other studies, the two different kinds of feedback led to differences in performance on the open-ended tasks (not on the fixedsolution ones). For example, students who received verbal feedback about how to do better thought of more uses for objects later than did students who had received grades. In addition, students who received comments reported higher levels of motivation on and more liking for the tasks than did those who received grades. What was new about this study was that grades and comments also had different impacts on what the students felt contributed to their performance: their theories of intelligence. Students who received comments attributed their performance to effort, interest, and skill, whereas students who received grades were more apt to attribute their performance to the reader’s mood: an external, uncontrollable variable. If one has an incremental theory, skill is something one can control. The reader’s mood, on the other hand, is outside one’s control. The literature on learned helplessness and issues discussed in chapter 3 arise. As was discussed there, entity theorists tend to feel helpless in the face of failure. Attributions of effort aligned with these different perceptions of what underlay their performance. Students in the grades group attributed their effort to a desire to avoid failure, whereas those who received comments attributed their effort to their interest in the task. The entity theorists’ performance goals are thus apparent in the group who received grades. Grades and other evaluations, then, undermine motivation perhaps in part because they tend to lead to performance goals instead of mastery ones. Grades appear to lead children to view their level of performance as reflecting their being smart or dumb, not as indicative of having studied hard or not.",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_1232,"Fifth- and sixth-grade students were presented a supplementary set of lessons focused on fractions (Anand & Ross, 1987). Children were randomly assigned to groups and for each group, instruction using the same example problems was couched in contexts designed to have different interest appeal. For the abstract group, all of the instruction examples were presented with general referents (""solid, liquid"") without any meaningful background theme. For example, one item read, ""There are three objects. Each is cut in one-half. In all, how many pieces would there be?"" (p. 73). The concrete group received hypothetical but concrete referents, for example stating that Bill had three candy bars, each of which he cut in half. The third group had examples that were intended to be most interesting, because they were personalized to concern matters of subjective importance, such as one’s birthday, teachers and friends, hobbies, and so on. For example, their teacher (mentioned by name) presented them with three Mars bars (their favorite candy) on their birthday, and if they cut each candy bar in half, how many friends could they share with? As bookends to these lessons, children took pre- and post-tests of their understanding of fractions. The results were clear in supporting that children learn best when the material is of personal interest. On the post-test, the abstract group scored lowest (averaging 2 of 11 problems correct), the concrete next-lowest (3.5 of 11), and the personalized group had the highest score (6 of 11).

The results showed that these students advanced dramatically in math, from the 30th to the 70th percentile, during the year of the intervention.

When paged, they filled out a form specifying their thoughts and activities at that moment. Three years later, the students’ progress in their talent areas was assessed. It was found that children’s achievement across the three years was directly related to the level of interest and excitement they expressed when engaged in the activity at the first time point.

Nine- to 11-year-olds were taught a computer math game, strangely titled (in the real world), ‘How the West Was One + Three x Four’ (Seiler, 1989) ... Children in the control condition saw the game in an unembellished, rather banal format, with the title of ‘Math Game.’ For the other children, the game was presented within a spaceship fantasy context and either had the title ‘Space Quest’ and involved the child imagining she or he was piloting a spaceship to other planets to save Earth from an energy crisis, or else had the title ‘Treasure Hunt,’ and involved imagining he or she was the captain of a ship seeking buried treasure. Some children also had personalized games that began with the child’s name (‘Best of luck in your journey, Commander Christy’) and sent the child off on the journey with his or her own personal favorite foods. Children played these games three times at school over a two-week period, for 30 minutes each time. A week later they were tested on their knowledge of the use of parentheses in arithmetic expressions as well as their knowledge of arithmetic operations in a different context. Their enjoyment of the game, their own assessment of their performance, and their desired level of challenge in future games were also assessed. The results were quite clear. When interesting contexts had been provided, children showed better knowledge of how parentheses affect arithmetic operations and were better able to transfer that knowledge to non-computer contexts. Personalization augmented these effects. In addition, students’ motivation was clearly influenced by the manipulation. Students in the context conditions were much more likely to opt for the computer playing its best game, liked the game more, were more willing to stay after school to play the game, believed themselves to be better at the games, and indicated they would seek a more challenging game later.

Such people view mistakes as learning opportunities, and when they err, they continue to engage in the task with the aim of mastering it. The second is a helpless pattern, in which people back down from challenges, opting for easier tasks instead.

The researchers were particularly interested in how feedback about a child’s success would impact a child’s later response to failure, because of the common practice of praising children for their successes by telling them they are smart, good, and so on.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1252,"In the first experiment, children were given three sets of problems to solve. The first set was a moderately difficult one, so all the children did fairly well. At that point, all of the children were told, “Wow, you did very well on these problems.” No matter how they had actually done, all the children were told they had gotten 80% right. “That’s a really high score.” (Children were “debriefed” about the experiment later.) Then, roughly a third of the children were told, “You must be smart at these problems,” in effect giving them an entity or fixed-trait reason for their high score. A different third were told, “You must have worked hard at these problems,” implying an incremental theory of intelligence. The remaining children received no additional feedback. Presumably these children retain their native theory of intelligence, which in the general population is about 43% incremental and about 43% entity. (The rest do not fit clearly into either pattern.) Next, children were told they could do more problems, and were asked to choose what kind of problems they would like, as a measure of their achievement orientation. They were offered a choice of “Problems that aren’t too hard, so I don’t get many wrong,” “Problems that are pretty easy, so I’ll do well,” or “Problems that I’m pretty good at, so I can show that I’m smart” (p. 35). These first three options endorse performance goals and go along with an entity theory, spawning a desire to perform well in order to look intelligent. A fourth option endorsed a learning goal and thus an incremental theory: “Problems that I’ll learn a lot from even if I won’t look so smart.” After stating their preferred choice, children went on to instead do a second, more difficult set of problems that they were told the experimenter had previously chosen. Their own choices would be granted, the experimenter told them, if there was extra time at the end of the session. After completing the second set of problems, they were told they had performed a lot worse on it than on the first set. To check for the impact of the different kinds of success attribution feedback on response to this failure experience, children were next asked about their desire to take some more problems home with them, their enjoyment of the task, their perceptions about how they had done, and their attributions for how they had done. They were then given a third set of problems, which was moderately difficult, like the first set, to allow for an assessment of how the experimental intervention influenced performance. After this final task, all children were debriefed and told the second set of problems was much harder than the first, and was in fact designed for seventh-graders. The researchers ensured that all children felt proud of their performance before leaving the experiment. The results of this study are extremely interesting in terms of their implications for how rapidly children respond to feedback endorsing an entity or an incremental view. Regarding achievement motivation, 92% of the children who had received effort praise chose the learning goal after the first set of problems, by asking to receive additional problems that they would learn from. By comparison, just 8% of the children who had received the intelligence praise chose this option. The other 92% of the children who had received intelligence praise opted for problems that would be easy so they could look smart or do well. Among the children who had gotten no feedback, about half chose performance and half chose learning goals, in keeping with the baseline representation of entity and mastery theorists in the general U.S. population.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1253,"Children’s post-failure attributions after the second set of problems were also affected by the intervention. Those who had been praised for effort after the first problem set attributed their subsequent failure to diminished effort, whereas those who were praised for ability attributed their subsequent failure to lack of ability. Task enjoyment was also very much affected, with children who were praised for intelligence reporting less enjoyment of the task than children who were praised for effort. In terms of persistence, children praised for effort were more likely to want to take some additional problems home. Finally, performance on the third set of problems was also influenced by the intervention feedback after the first set. Children praised for effort did better on the third set of problems than they had on the first set, and children praised for intelligence performed worse. Children who had received no praise showed no change. Thus a single sentence of feedback attributing success to intelligence or effort was associated with a cascade of remarkably different reactions to a subsequent failure event. In five subsequent experiments, the researchers replicated and extended these basic findings. When people with an entity view of intelligence (enduring or induced by feedback) face failure, they attribute the failure to a fixed quality of the self. In the context of such an attribution, people avoid further challenge, instead seeking evidence that they are indeed smart. If brief experimenter feedback can have such a large impact on children, parent and teacher feedback, which continues over time and comes from people who are very important to a child, would be expected to have even more. As was discussed in chapter 5, even when teachers simply told children a test would show “how good you are in relation to other children your age,” children’s performance declined (Graham & Golan, 1991).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

In the absence of particular feedback manipulations, children’s responses to challenging situations has been shown to remain stable from kindergarten until fifth grade (Ziegert, Kistner, Castro, & Robertson, 2001), and there is no reason to believe they change thereafter. The research suggests that how adults talk to children about their accomplishments has a host of important consequences. Dweck (1999) describes many other interesting outcomes and considerations regarding these two theories of self as malleable or fixed.

It means marking them from 0 to 10. How can a zero correct anyone’s defects?” (1967a, p. 245). Instead, Dr. Montessori counseled that correction comes from the child’s own observation of his mistakes in the outcome, and that the materials the child works with should make it obvious to the child when he has erred (see the discussion in chapter 5 on the Control of Error).",Montessori,Academic/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

The first band is by age level: most of the children in the classroom are born within one year of each other, with a set birth date as the cut-off for being part of a classroom. Within each classroom, in many schools children are also grouped by ability level for each subject (“tracked”). By learning in this manner, children are removed from other children who are at very different levels. Their learning occurs in a narrow ability band. This is convenient to a factory model, since factories operate most efficiently if all of the raw materials are uniform. It suits the Lockean model of the child as well, since children at the same level are assumed to be alike and thus ready for the same knowledge to be poured in.",Traditional,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1264,"To examine this, researchers exposed toddlers to either a female adult or a 3-year-boy performing a variety of actions (Ryalls, Gul, & Ryalls, 2000). While sitting on their mothers’ laps, the children observed the model performing action sequences such as inserting a ball into a plastic egg, closing the egg, and shaking it. To see if they imitated the model’s actions, children were given the objects immediately and again after a one-week delay. Regardless of the delay time, children who had seen a slightly older peer model replicated a greater number of complex action sequences than did children exposed to an adult model, suggesting the peer elicited more imitation. This is a fascinating finding in need of replication. Because only one model was used for each condition, it is possible that some other difference in the models besides their peer/adult status was responsible for the result. We know, for example, that people are particularly apt to imitate those with whom they have better rapport (Bernieri, 1988), and perhaps children felt more rapport with the child for reasons other than age. More research is needed on this issue, using several different peer and adult models, but the finding is intriguing.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1265,"Montessori encourages learning from peers in part by using three-year age groupings. This ensures that as children move through the classroom they will be exposed to older and younger peers, facilitating both imitative learning and peer tutoring (discussed later). Dr. Montessori was quite clear about the need for this mix of ages: “The main thing is that the groups should contain different ages. . . . To have success you must have these different ages. . . . The older children are interested in the younger, and the younger in the older” (Montessori, 1989, pp. 68–69). A child enters the Primary classroom at 21 ⁄2 or 3 years of age and remains there until he or she has completed the “cycle of materials,” the full set of materials Dr. Montessori determined was optimal for a Primary classroom. For most children, the full set takes about three years to master.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_1272,"The construct of attachment was first discussed by the British ethnologist and psychoanalyst John Bowlby (1969) as an explanation for the failure of many babies to thrive in European orphanages following World War II--they lacked a close relationship with an adult. According to attachment theory, children need a close adult who will function as a secure base from which to explore the world and a safe haven to which to retreat in times of stress. The psychologist Mary Ainsworth (1967), Bowlby’s colleague, moved the attachment construct from the theoretical to the empirical realm by establishing a method to assess attachment. Her method has been very important to our understanding of child development because it allows us to make reliable long-term predictions of child outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1273,"The paradigm Ainsworth devised to measure attachment is called the Strange Situation. The infant, usually between 12 and 18 months of age (the test may not be valid outside of that age range), is brought into a room full of toys with his or her mother. Over the next 15 or 20 minutes, the mother and a stranger come and go in a series of prearranged episodes. At one point the child is alone with the toys, then the door opens and in walks not the mother but the stranger. This is often very upsetting to the child, who usually already appeared stressed over being left alone. A moment later the mother returns, and the behavior of the child during this reunion is particularly diagnostic for attachment classification.",Traditional,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

The most common pattern in American babies, termed secure attachment, is characterized by a child seeming unambiguously glad to see the mother and seeking and obtaining comfort from her. Approximately 70% of American babies respond in this way at 12 to 18 months, and they tend to develop most positively in the years to come.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1275,"Different patterns of child behavior characterize different attachment styles (Weinfield, Sroufe, Egeland, & Carlson, 1999) ... some babies appear to avoid the mother--they do not look her in the eye and seem determined to try to be independent.

These latter two patterns are characteristic of insecure attachment relationships, and children who display these forms of attachment fare less well over time.",Traditional,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1276,"As stated, long-term outcome studies favor the secure attachment style. For example, in one study, children whose attachment status had been classified when they were infants returned to the laboratory at 2 years of age to engage in some problem-solving tasks with their mothers. Children previously rated as securely attached were more competent problem solvers, were more persistent, showed more enthusiasm, and were also more compliant with their mothers (Matas, Arend, & Sroufe, 1978).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

When children were told they were not doing well in the game, securely attached children upped their efforts, whereas insecurely attached children decreased their efforts. After failing, securely attached children displayed sadness more openly, which child psychologists regard positively; internalizing or not showing one’s feelings is associated with such later problems as childhood depression.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_1280,"The secure attachment construct has also been extended beyond its roots in infancy and applied to people’s representations of intimate relationships throughout the lifespan. The attachment Q-sort was developed to measure attachment security in the preschool and school years (Waters & Deane, 1985). For this measure, the child’s teacher or some other trained observer sorts preselected statements concerning a child’s possible profile into piles indicating whether the statements are more or less characteristic of the child. The statements are about such issues as how the child responds to fearful situations, the child’s predominant mood, and how often the child seeks proximity and comfort. Sort patterns are used to place children into the different attachment style categories, and these categories correspond closely with attachment classifications from the Strange Situation months or years earlier, and predict a similar range of developmental outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1281,"A measure used to assess attachment in adults is the Adult Attachment Interview, in which people are asked to describe their relationship with their parents (Bakermans-Kranenburg & Van Ijzendoorn, 1993; Hesse, 1999). Responses on this interview tend to be related to the interaction style of one’s current relationships (Treboux, Crowell, & Waters, 2004), to parenting behaviors (Adam, Gunnar, & Tanaka, 2004), and to one’s attachment classification as an infant. In one study, people who were tested in the Strange Situation as infants and as adults found that 72% of participants were classified with the convergent attachment styles at both time points (Waters, Merrick, Treboux, Crowell, & Albersheim, 2000). Thus, attachment is an enduring construct, applicable even beyond infancy.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1282,"Given the importance of the construct to predicting later competence and well-being, a pertinent question is what leads a child to have a particular type of relationship with the caregiver. Bowlby (1969) and Ainsworth (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) believed that an important antecedent factor in attachment style was adult sensitivity, and research has borne out that possibility (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Discussion following refers to maternal sensitivity because that was Ainsworth’s main concern, but the constructs seem to apply to any close caregiver. Important attachment relationships also of course develop with fathers (Grossmann et al., 2002), and they also appear to develop with day-care providers and teachers. Children growing up on Israeli kibbutzim become attached to their caregivers, and the quality of those relationships also predicts children’s outcomes (Oppenheim, Sagi, & Lamb, 1988). Children with a secure attachment to their kibbutz caregiver were later more goal directed and achievement oriented than were other children. This is consistent with work showing that American children’s relationships with their kindergarten teachers are related to their academic and behavioral outcomes through eighth grade (Hamre & Pianta, 2001).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1283,"Awareness requires that the mother be proximate to the infant so that she can perceive the infant’s signals. This aspect of attachment theory led to a concern beginning in the 1970s about whether babies placed in day care could become attached to their mothers. After many years of controversy, the recent National Study of Day Care, involving a representative sample of over 1,000 American children in a variety of day-care arrangements, has shown that use of day care has no significant impact on child-mother attachment relations (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). It is the mother’s awareness of signals when she is with the infant that appears to matter, and not that she is with the infant at all times. One might revise Ainsworth’s criteria for awareness, then, to read that the adult must be proximate to the infant for some reasonable amount of time, and when proximate, must be able to perceive the infant’s signals. A second aspect of awareness, besides proximity, is having a low perceiving threshold. The adult must notice the child’s signals.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1284,"The second major aspect of sensitivity for Ainsworth is accurate interpretation. Adults must interpret the babies’ signals for what they are, rather than distorting the signals in some way. Distortions could be caused by adults projecting their own needs on the infant, denying the infant’s needs because of their own needs, or any other biasing of the infant’s signals to accord with the adult’s own wishes and needs. Ainsworth noted that to overcome such proclivities, the adult must have self-insight. A second feature necessary to accurate interpretation, according to Ainsworth, is empathy. Adults who lack empathy, she said, would have detached, intellectual relations with babies instead of warm, sensitive ones. “A mother might be quite aware of and understand accurately the baby’s behavior and the circumstances leading to her baby’s distress or demands, but because she is unable to empathize with him -- unable to see things from the baby’s point to view--she may tease him back into good humor, mock him, laugh at him, or just ignore him” (Ainsworth, 1969, p. 2). Lack of empathy thus leads to inappropriate response.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1285,"Even correctly interpreted signals can be followed by inappropriate responses. The third main feature of sensitivity for Ainsworth is that the response to the perceived and accurately interpreted signal be an appropriate one. Ainsworth noted that in the first year, the appropriate response to the baby is almost always what the child “asks” for via his or her signals: pick the child up when the signal indicates a desire to be held, feed the child when the signal indicates hunger, and so on. After the first year, Ainsworth noted that doing exactly as the baby asks is no longer always the best response. As they get older, children increasingly need to adapt to the world, rather than always expecting the world to adapt to them. On the other hand, children also need to feel some sense of control or efficacy, as suggested by the research presented in chapter 3. Ainsworth advised that thebest response after age 1 is a compromise response that keeps the child’s long-range interests at heart.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1286,The final feature of sensitivity concerns timing of the response. Ainsworth noted that responses must be prompt to be effective. Adults who were devoted to a rigid feed or sleep schedule would be insensitive on this point. Responses need to be timed closely after the baby’s calls for attention for the baby to experience the efficacy of his or her actions.,Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1287,"Ainsworth’s theoretical ideas regarding sensitivity were compiled into a rating scale on which the sensitivity of primary caregivers to their children could be scored by trained observers watching mothers and children interact. Ainsworth’s original study of 23 mother-child pairs found a remarkably strong relationship between maternal sensitivity and child attachment classification (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Many studies have been done in the meantime, and the results are not as strong; some even fail to show a relationship. When results are inconsistent, the best response is a meta-analysis combining results across many studies. A recent meta-analysis of maternal sensitivity and attachment shows there is a relationship between the two factors, such that (in statistical terms) a child’s chances of being securely attached move from 38% if a mother is not sensitive to 62% if the mother is sensitive (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Because all scales and measures are prone to some degree of “measurement error,” the relationship in real terms might be stronger.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1288,"The issue of direction of effects naturally arises here. Perhaps the reason some mothers respond sensitively has to do with characteristics of the infant, and those infant characteristics lead to the later positive outcomes. In this view, the mother has no direct bearing on the child’s later outcomes. The obvious infant characteristic to consider is the child’s personality (or temperament), and studies have been done examining the relationship between child personality and attachment security (Vaughn & Bost, 1999). The upshot of these studies is that although personality predicts some aspects of behavior in the Strange Situation, it does not predict reunion behaviors, which are the most diagnostic of relationship quality.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1289,"One could still argue, however, that some aspect of the child is responsible for attachment classification. Experimental designs can address this. In fact, several intervention studies have been conducted, in which mothers were trained to respond more sensitively to their infants and changes in attachment classification following the intervention were examined. A recent meta-analysis of 88 intervention studies showed that short, focused interventions related to maternal sensitivity were effective both in making parents respond more sensitively to their infants and in changing infant attachment status (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van Ijzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). Such work strongly suggests that maternal sensitivity has a causal relationship to attachment classification.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1290,"Ainsworth’s rating scales were designed for observation of mothers with their infants. But a mother’s interaction style with a child evolves over time. Other research has looked at how parents of securely attached infants behave toward them somewhat later, as toddlers and preschoolers. One can view this as addressing how the sensitive pattern of responding adapts as children age. Mothers whose children were insecurely attached as infants tend to interact more intrusively with them in first and second grades (Egeland, Pianta, & O’Brien, 1993). Their interaction styles are more directive, such that they are more apt to tell their children exactly what to do. In contrast, parents of securely attached children tend not simply to tell the children what to do, but instead make suggestions, helping children to figure things out for themselves (Fagot, Gauvain, & Kavanagh, 1996; Frankel & Bates, 1990; Matas et al., 1978; Moss, 1992). They are closely involved, but nonintrusive. In Bruner’s (1975) terms, echoing Vygotsky, parents of securely attached children provide ideal scaffolds for children, structuring the environment such that children can internalize problem-solving strategies (see also Gauvain, 2001), whereas parents of insecurely attached children are more directive. Secure attachment styles in infancy are associated with parenting styles that evolve in positive ways as children get older.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1291,"Dr. Montessori advised that teachers show a degree of warmth and sensitivity that is reminiscent of the characteristics of parents whose children are securely attached. The focal period for forming attachment relationships (12 to 18 months) is of course usually prior to the age of entry into a Montessori classroom. Yet there is nothing to indicate that the adult behaviors associated with particular attachment styles cease to matter, and indeed those behaviors are consistent with literature suggesting optimal parenting practices for older children as well.

excerpt_1292,"Dr. Montessori saw the task of childhood as being to become increasingly independent, and the role of the adult as assisting children toward that independence. As is indicated in the quote above, Dr. Montessori maintained the teacher should serve as a safe haven whenever the child needs that. Yet when the child is ready to explore, the Montessori teacher was advised to be sensitive to the child’s need for increased independence, heeding the child’s call to “Help me to do it alone!” (Montessori, 1948/1976, p. 103).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Indeed, Dr. Montessori (1917/1965) said, “The fundamental quality [teachers must possess was] a capacity for observation” (p. 130). Like the sensitive parents described by Ainsworth (1969), teachers’ thresholds for perceiving signals should be low. They should be trained to notice and correctly interpret the behavioral manifestations of the child’s inner state, in order to know what to do next. As is discussed later in the chapter with regard to teacher training, Dr. Montessori also advised teachers to develop self-understanding, so they do not misinterpret children’s signals in ways that align with their own needs.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1294,"When children are concentrating on work, Dr. Montessori held that they should be left alone, because during such moments, she believed, they are developing themselves. In chapter 3, I discussed the idea that concentration might be an engine of self-regulation, which is associated with many positive personality variables. Dr. Montessori saw concentration as the moment of self-development. Because of this theoretical stance, she held that teachers must watch for any concentrated purposeful movement, so as to let it go undisturbed; the child must be protected from stimuli that would break the concentration. For example, Dr. Montessori described an incident in which a child who had thus far been disorderly in school one day began to rearrange the furniture, with an expression of intense interest. The teacher was inclined to stop him, but Dr. Montessori saw his activity as coordinated toward a useful end, and manifesting that child’s first moments of concentration on purposeful activity in the classroom. According to Dr. Montessori, a sensitive teacher would leave a child alone in such actions, as long as the child was not disturbing others.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1295,"The Montessori teacher must also be sensitive to when the child is ready for something new, because “the brain always asks for work which becomes more complex” (Montessori, 1989, p. 89). After great concentration a child may need to rest or simply observe others (Montessori, 1989, p. 19), but at a certain point the child will be ready for more complex work. The teacher must be attuned to such moments, and give the child new work when the child is ready. Further, like parents of securely attached children in problem-solving situations, the Montessori teacher must structure the environment in such a way that children can make discoveries on their own. Telling children, as traditional teaching often involves, is associated with insecure attachment relationships.",Montessori,Cognitive/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Being businesslike was important in this approach as well; such concepts as “emotional warmth” do not figure prominently in behaviorist discourse; in the rare instances when Thorndike mentions emotional qualities for a teacher, it tends to be in a footnote (e.g., Thorndike, 1906/1962, p. 63). Thorndike’s recommendation for how a teacher should give instructions, for example, was to say, “Do the work on this page. Do it again, keeping track of how many minutes you spend. Practice again until you can get all the answers right in 12 minutes” (Thorndike, 1921b, p. 17). Communication was to be simple, direct, and dry. Beyond a few such mentions, the literature reflecting the factory and empty-vessel models is not particularly detailed regarding how teachers should behave toward children.",Traditional,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

They tend to be very strict about what the rules are, but also willing to discuss them, reason with the child, and when sensible even alter the rules in response to the child’s expressed views. Yet within the limits they set, authoritative parents allow children considerable freedom. They are warmly affectionate and communicate openly. They also are demanding, and expect maturity. Children of authoritative parents are clearly the best off, high in achievement motivation and in self-control. They tend to be more popular, competent, and self-assured than other children.

As children got older, however, parents’ continued directiveness was associated with lower levels of cognitive functioning. Adult sensitivity to when a greater or lesser degree of scaffolding is needed is very important. All children benefit from some level of demandingness and control, but as children become more competent, adults’ continued directiveness becomes negative.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1318,"Consistent with the work on authoritative parenting, Dr. Montessori advised teachers to give children freedom within clear boundaries. “Young people must have enough freedom to allow them to act on individual initiative.

excerpt_1319,"Dr. Montessori also counseled that adults give reasons to children. This is particularly clear in her discussions of how to present material to children in From Childhood to Adolescence: information is always presented in the context of reasons and explanations. “The mind of the child [particularly from 6 to 12] is not satisfied with the mere collection of facts; he tries to discover their causes” (1948/1976, p. 36). Children in the Elementary years, she wrote, need to understand why, not just what, and the research on parenting shows children fare better when parents do provide reasons.",Montessori,Academic/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1320,"Authoritative parents also have high expectations, and, relative to other school systems’ expectations of children, those put forth in Montessori classrooms may well be considered high. In fact, Montessori’s decline from an initial period of great popularity in the United States around 1920 is often attributed to the writing of education professor William Kilpatrick (1914), who opposed Montessori’s introduction of reading and writing to children before they reach the age of 6 and is discussed further in chapter 10. Books at such an early age were deemed harmful by several of Montessori’s contemporaries. Montessori clearly has high academic and behavioral expectations of children, which Dr. Montessori would say are the result of children themselves indicating what they were capable of and drawn to when free within a specially prepared environment.",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1321,"As discussed in chapter 5, Dr. Montessori also wrote of people expecting too little of children by giving them many toys and fairy tales, but little of real life. If children can imagine fairy tales, she wrote, why not ask them to imagine parts of the real earth that they cannot see? Children apparently surprised her repeatedly by showing interest in real activities over play, and she responded by creating an educational system that expects maturity, as do authoritative parents. This can put people off, because they see Montessori education as not being sufficiently fun. Empirical research should more directly address this issue, but the Middle School study mentioned previously (Rathunde & Csikszentmihalyi, in press) and other work concerning children’s motivation and affect when engaged in Montessori-like practices (collaborative learning, lack of extrinsic rewards, and so) in traditional settings suggest that it is probably not a concern. Children do appear to enjoy learning in the circumstances of Montessori classrooms.",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1322,"As was discussed earlier, Dr. Montessori advised that adults show great emotional warmth when dealing with children. Children must have “a teacher who looks on them with love and hope” (Montessori, 1989, p. 79). Yet at the same time, the adult’s ultimate control of the environment was clearly a high priority. The pitfalls of permissive adult attitudes were pointed out in her writing. “If freedom is understood as letting the children do as they like, using or more likely misusing, the things available, it is clear that only their ‘deviations’ are free to develop” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 206). Permissive parents are often thought of as ones who want to be their children’s friends; it is hard for them to exercise authority. Dr. Montessori saw the dangers in this: “The teacher must be superior and not just a friend. . . . [Children] need a dignified, mature person. . . . If they have no authority, they have no directive. Children need this support” (1989, p. 17). Some Montessori teachers, like some parents, err in this regard. They do not provide ultimate control over the environment, deal effectively with unproductive behaviors, or guide children’s decisions in positive ways. Freedom can thus be taken to an extreme, and Dr. Montessori counseled against this repeatedly. “One time I saw an entire class of disorganized children who were using the materials completely wrongly. The teacher drifted about in the class, silent as the Sphinx. . . . This teacher was committing a grave error: She feared disturbing their disorder, instead of attempting to establish the order” (Montessori, 1956, p. 140).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1323,"Another not uncommon error in Montessori teaching is the opposite one: for teachers to be overly rigid about the method, in a manner reminiscent of authoritarian parents. Dr. Montessori also spoke against an authoritarian stance: “The teacher can address the pupil energetically and severely and thus jolt him out of his behavior, but those who know their jobs well have means more effective than coercion for recalling the pupil to order” (1956, p. 141). Authoritarian parents tell children to do things because the parent says so; they do not reason with the child, and they appear to take on a stance that they are infallible. Yet adults who work with children have to admit to being fallible (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246). Education, she said, was traditionally “directed toward the suppression or bending of the child’s will, and the substitution for it of the teacher’s will, which demands from the child unquestioning obedience” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 252). Against the behaviorist trend, she said, “We cannot directly mold. . . . individual forms of character, intelligence, and feeling” (1917/1965, p. 9).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1324,"The degree to which Montessori teachers take an authoritative stance, and whether their degree of authoritativeness is associated with more optimal academic, social, and personal outcomes, are important issues for empirical research. Dr. Montessori’s ideas about how teachers should behave toward children were clearly in line with today’s research on parenting styles. They should provide an appropriately structured environment in which children are free to make their own decisions and discoveries. They should intervene only when children’s behavior is not constructive. They should have high expectations and give reasons, all with warm love.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1325,"The fact that teachers get reputations that hold across the years suggests that teacher orientations are more stable, but a wealth of research in psychology also shows that people are much more influenced by the situation they are in than we sometimes expect (Ross & Nisbett, 1991). Still, my guess is that a new class of children in the same school would not strongly affect a teacher’s responses and that teachers were the main causal factor in children’s responses. In addition, in chapter 3 I mentioned a study in which teachers were trained to give children more control in the classroom, and positive changes were observed in their students (De Charms, 1976).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1326,"The study of teacher responses and child outcomes mentioned earlier in this section was replicated in Russia and revealed the same basic pattern of results. Unfortunately, as children get older in traditional American schools, the schools increasingly take away, rather than increase, children’s autonomy. Research in psychology has shown that when teachers have independence goals for children, children tend to have more intrinsic motivation to learn, and also to be higher in self-esteem.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1327,"The current swing toward external testing standards promotes the opposite behaviors in teachers. In one study, when teachers were told their students would have to pass specific educational standards, teachers became more controlling, talked and commanded more, gave students less choice and autonomy, and expressed more criticism of students (Deci, Spiefel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kaufman, 1982). Both as children get older, and when standardized testing is emphasized, teachers in traditional schools become more prone to create classroom environments that are at odds with more optimal child outcomes. In the context of traditional education, teachers can attempt to overcome the negative effects of grades and testing, and the inherently competitive, comparative system they create. The system, however, was designed for their use, and as the current enthusiasm for high-stakes testing shows, as a culture we keep returning to it. Teacher’s expectations of children and how they communicate do impact learning and self theories in classrooms.",Traditional,Academic/Behavioral,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1328,"The literature on teachers and classrooms also mirrors Dr. Montessori’s approach. First, as was discussed with reference to authoritative parenting, Montessori teachers’ expectations are high. Children are expected to achieve a good deal both academically and socially in Montessori classrooms. They achieve this in part by their own self-control. The Montessori teacher’s goal is clearly the child’s self-regulation; the teacher’s task was well done when the teacher was needed only to give additional lessons. “Any pedagogical action, if it is to be efficacious in the training of little children, must tend to help the children to advance upon this road of independence” (Montessori, 1912/1964, p. 97).

Before concentration occurs, the directress may do more or less what she thinks best; she may interfere with the children’s activities as much as she thinks necessary” (1967a, p. 278).

She recommended doing so by redirection rather than punishment. “Interfere by all means to stop disturbances, but we need not punish or scold or admonish when we stop bad behavior; we can ask the child to come and pick flowers in the garden or offer a toy or any occupation that will appeal to [the child]” (Montessori, 1989, p. 16).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

When a child comes to an adult seeking praise, she said, then the child needs praise as assurance that he or she is on the right track (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 88).

excerpt_1341,"An ability to observe children and detect their needs is fundamental to good Montessori teaching. Dr. Montessori maintained that the capacity to observe children has to be carefully developed through long practice (1917/1965, p. 130). In the AMI Montessori teacher training courses, scores of hours are spent with children, observing their actions, recording those observations, and crafting them into reports to be reviewed by the teacher trainer. Dr. Montessori advocated training in science, rather than in education, for people who would go into Montessori teaching, in part because training in science is training in close observation (Montessori, 1917/1965, p. 138). She was also concerned that training in traditional education might make it more difficult to become a good Montessori teacher. “An ordinary teacher cannot be transformed into a Montessori teacher, but must be created anew, having rid herself of pedagogical prejudices” (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 87).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

This emphasis on one’s personal preparation to be a teacher contrasts sharply with traditional teacher training, which focuses more on how one does things than on one’s own psychology.

Lectures and practicums enable trainees to learn about the materials and the variety of ways in which they can be used to stimulate interest and use, as well as the interconnections between materials across the curriculum.

The knowledge in these albums is of course not as deep and thorough as that of the teacher trainer, just as the notes of a student taking a college course would not reflect all the knowledge of the professor, but they are sufficiently thorough to allow the teacher to refer to them over the coming years, and to guide his or her lessons in the future. Some other Montessori teacher training courses routinely give teachers copies of the information rather than having them write and illustrate it themselves.

Half of the subjects were told they could terminate the noise at anytime with a switch, but they were discouraged from doing so and few people actually used the switch, whereas others were simply subjected to the loud noise, with no suggestion that they could control it. Even though they had not opted to control the noise, those who believed themselves able to control it noticed significantly more errors on the proofreading task and were significantly more persistent in their attempts to solve the tangram puzzles.

The manipulation of interest was a pretreatment of uncontrollable noise, as opposed to controllable noise. After a period in which they heard noise which they believed they could escape, participants were subsequently significantly more likely to discover the pattern in the anagrams.

The countries are painted different colors, and each has a knob allowing it to be easily lifted out.

However, even if some reverse directions of effect are sometimes partly responsible for findings, it is likely that parent-to-child effects also occur. This is suggested by the fact that adult imposition of structure improves the outcomes of children with ADHD (MTA Cooperative Group, 1999) and that when parents enact bedtime routines, children’s sleep patterns improve (Seymour, Brock, During, & Poole, 1989).",Traditional,Environment,Study,excerpt,Order in Environment and Mind,excerpt_dataset,

The disrupted routines themselves might have no direct effect on child functioning. Another potential third variable is family income. Several studies have noted that a feature of low-income children’s homes is the lack of order (Klaus & Gray, 1968; Pavenstedt, 1965), and low-income families are also often less educated and bear other features that could independently lead to poorer child outcomes.",Traditional,Environment,Study,excerpt,Order in Environment and Mind,excerpt_dataset,

If children could read the name on a card, she promised, they could play with the toy as a reward. Like many adults, she assumed rewards were positive and even necessary to get children to engage in difficult tasks. The children, however, showed her differently. They eagerly read the words, but showed no interest in the toys, asking instead for another word to read. This suggested to her that a challenging activity, reading (for new readers), could be motivating in and of itself. The extrinsic reward of playing with a toy was not valued, and in fact seemed an undesired distraction from their real mission.

The teacher assists the child’s learning by showing the child how widely one has to stretch one’s arms to hold the longest one versus a shorter one, how the rods differ in weight, and so on. With the help of their bodies, children learn to perceive the differences in the Red Rods and to line them up from shortest to longest.

The structural organization involved was a diorama of a miniature town, into which 20 small items, including animals, cars, people, and so on, were logically placed while the children, Maya and American 8- and 9-year-olds, looked on. The 20 objects were then replaced into the pool of 80 items from which they were drawn, and the children were asked to reconstruct the scene. Although the Maya sample had shown much poorer memory previously on a standard list task, their performance was even slightly better than that of the American children in this organized task. Although children learn to memorize lists of unrelated items in Traditional schools, one might question whether this is a good use of their processing resources.Transitive inference tasks are ones in which one learns that A > B and B > C, and one must infer that A > C.

When the child did not see the object under the first pillow, the child gave up. Piaget then showed the child how he had moved the object, and repeated the procedure. The child behaved in exactly the same way, whereupon Piaget lifted the second pillow and asked, ""Didn’t you see I put it here?"" (on the prior hiding trial). ""Yes,"" his child replied, ""but it should be there"" (pointing to the first pillow) (Montessori, 1966, pp. 53–54). Although to Piaget this task was probably about inference, to Dr. Montessori the incident was about the child’s need to find the object in its proper place. She also noted that children often play hide-and-seek by hiding in the same place over and over, or in the place where the last hider was just found. She saw this as also reflecting a need for order, for there being set places and times for objects and events.

Vygotsky argued that learning occurs in a zone of proximal development, meaning over tasks one cannot yet accomplish alone but can accomplish in the company of a more advanced other.

Bandura showed children films of an adult hitting a wobbly blow-up “Bobo” doll and noted that children were later apt to behave toward the doll as the adult had. According to behaviorists, such learning should not have occurred, because children were not rewarded directly for the behaviors they later enacted. The studies made the point that learning can occur by simply watching what others do, irrespective of personal rewards. Along with other important developments at the time, Bandura’s work helped to turn the dominant paradigm of American psychology from behaviorism to cognitive science",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1516,"Dr. Montessori described an early case in which it became apparent to her that children’s tendency to imitate others can be a useful source of inlearning from peers 197 spiration in school, advancing children to new abilities. This observation, called the “explosion” into writing, recurs annually in well-functioning Montessori Primary classrooms when the first 4-year-old suddenly realizes, after months of working with the preparatory materials, that he or she can write. “The first word to be written by one of them brought a great outburst of joy and laughter. Everyone looked admiringly at ‘the writer,’ and thus they felt moved to follow his example. ‘I can do it too!’ they cried. The achievement of one started off the whole group” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 231). Other 4-year-olds, having also been indirectly prepared to write through the use of knobs on Wooden Cylinders and other materials, pencils in Metal Insets, and so on, as was described in chapter 1, spontaneously began writing in reaction to having observed a first child reaching that landmark. Obviously children also see others learn to write in traditional schools; what is unique in Montessori is the series of steps, all visible and imitable, that lead children along the path to writing, so that a community of 4-year-olds can discover they already have the ability to write once they see it done by another child.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1517,"Children also can learn about social behavior in Montessori classrooms by observing how others behave in natural, nonscripted situations. Whereas in traditional classrooms, children learn how to sit still and listen to the teacher, in Montessori, they can learn how to interact with each other.

excerpt_1519,"One might wonder how learning by observation in a Montessori classroom is possible for the oldest children, who are working at the highest levels with many of the available materials.

excerpt_1522,"One study of the efficacy of such a system (“Classwide Peer Tutoring”) involved first- and second-grade classrooms in low-income schools (Greenwood et al., 1987). Classrooms were randomly assigned to tutoring and control conditions for spelling. In control classrooms, teachers used standard methods of teaching spelling: a workbook with word lists and vocabulary exercises, chalkboard, self-study, and homework assignments. In classrooms that used the tutoring program, the tutoring process described earlier replaced some in-class spelling work. Over the two years of the study, children in the peer tutoring classrooms were spelling 87% of the words correctly on average, whereas children in other classrooms were spelling 75% of words correctly. This is not an enormous difference, but it is certainly a meaningful one. Peering tutoring programs also appear to confer many social benefits on the classroom (Fantuzzo, Riggio, Connelly, & Dimeff, 1989; Maheady & Sainato, 1985). In addition, they apparently benefit learning other topics and over the long term",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1523,"In one demonstration of these benefits, a follow-up study expanded the peer tutoring to cover reading, math, and language, and examined children’s performance over multiple years. Children in the tutoring program performed significantly better than those in the control group on all three topics both immediately and two years later, when they had moved on to middle school and no longer had the program. They also performed better in two nontutored topics: science and social studies. They even performed as well as children in a higher SES group in all these areas (Greenwood et al., 1989). In addition, fewer children from the peer tutoring group were placed in special-education classes (Greenwood, Terry, Utley, Montagna, & Walker, 1993). This study is among many suggesting that peer tutoring programs, appropriately structured, improve learning in traditional schools and that the benefits extend across time and topics (see Topping & Ehly, 1998).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1524,"Peer tutoring programs vary in terms of how structured each tutoring session is, and more structured programs are typically associated with greater success. Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) is an example of a more structured tutoring program (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998), and it has also been used to examine the effect of rewards. RPT begins with training sessions about teamwork and cooperation, and children are told they can win rewards by using teamwork. In the RPT program, teaching aides show the children how to tutor each other. Then RPT sessions are held twice weekly for 45 minutes each. Special flash-card materials are used, with a problem on one side and steps to the solution on the other. Children decide who will be tutor first in each session, and work for 10 minutes on problems before switching roles. After the initial 20 minutes, problem drill sheets are administered, and students attempt the problems, then switch papers with partners for correction. Performance on the drill sheets accrues points, which lead to such rewards as being teacher’s helper or working on a special project. When children were randomly assigned to RPT versus traditional instruction groups, those in the RPT groups consistently showed higher levels of mathematics achievement (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998). Two alternative groups were also formed, one with the reward but lacking the structure provided by the flash cards, and the other having the structure but no reward. The combination of rewards and structure led to the most gains in both achievement and positive social behavior. Structure alone, without rewards, was associated with better behavior both in the tutoring sessions and in the regular classroom situation. Students also perceived themselves to be more competent when using structured than when using unstructured tutoring, but achievement was not improved in the absence of rewards (Fantuzzo, King, & Heller, 1992). Thus, within a traditional school environment, more structured peer interactions with a reward structure optimized learning and behavior. The issue of rewards is important and is discussed further in the context of collaborative learning.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1525,"Although supplementing whole-class teaching with peer tutoring improves achievement, adults are even more effective tutors than peers. The research suggests several reasons for this that shed light on how peer tutoring can be most effective. First, adults structure the task in ways that keep the overarching goal in clear focus, whereas child partners tend to focus on parts of the problem, losing sight of the whole--a difference reminiscent of the differences between same-age experts and novices. For example, if the task is planning a route for doing a set of errands as efficiently as possible, child pairs will get the errands done, but not as efficiently, because they focus on each individual item to be retrieved separately, rather than thinking about how several items can be grouped to make for more efficient routes. Adult tutors get children to think about grouping items. However, when the peer tutor is trained in this task and taught to consider how to group items, tutee performance does improve. Nonetheless, performance even with a trained peer tutor does not improve to the level obtained when the tutor was an adult (Gauvain, 2001).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1526,"A second probable reason for the greater success of adult tutors is that adults tend to include children more in the task at hand. Other children can become autocratic, as children are inclined to focus on who gets to do what. Children tend to like to do; adults more easily sit back, watch, and guide. Research has shown that peer learning is also more successful when peers listen to each other and question each other more (reviewed below), skills that many adults have but many children have not yet learned (Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1527,"Perhaps in part because peer tutors can become autocratic, some research suggests that, when tutored by a peer, the tutee benefits maximally from a peer who is just a bit more advanced rather than much more advanced. For example, research on both scientific and moral reasoning has shown that children benefit from exposure to thought processes that are just above their current level (Damon & Killen, 1982; Kuhn, 1972; Turiel & Rothman, 1972)",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1528,"Besides being less able to adapt to a lower level of tutee, much older and more advanced peer tutors sometimes practice social dominance. The problems of autocracy mentioned earlier thus become exacerbated, and the tutee learns less, because he or she is less involved in the decision-making process. This was found in a study in which 5-year-old novices were paired either with 5- or 7-year-olds who were considered experts at planning routes (as in the study just described) (Duran & Gauvain, 1993). Children were more involved with the task when paired with an advanced planner of their own age, as opposed to an older planner, and this increased involvement predicted better performance. Whether the particular age gap used in this experiment (5 to 7) is a particularly problematic one would be an interesting topic for research. The age of 6 is a pivotal one, recognized in many of the world’s cultures as an appropriate time to ask more of children, such as by beginning formal schooling (Rogoff, 1981). Six is the age at which Piaget speculated children advance to being able to perform mental operations (for example, imagining addition and subtraction), and which Dr. Montessori considered transitional between her first and second planes of development. At each plane, she said, children think differently. Examining whether 6- and 8-, or 7- and 9-year-olds, make more effective tutoring pairs would be of interest. The research suggests that peers who are slightly advanced, but not too advanced, make more optimal tutors, but it might also be the case that tutors who are within particular age spans are best",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

After hearing the first story, children who did not solve it spontaneously (about 80% of them) were shown the solution. The second story was about a man who needed to get hay bales on a high tractor--a problem that could also be solved by stacking items. Some children were simply told the story, whereas others were asked to teach the solution to a Kermit the Frog puppet.

excerpt_1532,"The psychologist Elliot Aronson designed the Jigsaw program initially to address the disturbances that followed the integration of public schools in Austin, Texas, in the 1960s (Aronson & Patnoe, 1997). He reasoned that close student contact, for the purpose of helping others, might alleviate problems, and so created learning arrangements that would lead to such contact. In the Jigsaw model, children are placed in groups of five or six and topics of study are broken into as many segments. For the topic of the Civil War, for example, one person might be assigned to study the history of slavery, another the type of weapons used in the era, another the major battles, 210 Montessori and so on. Children research their topic on their own, and then temporarily join a new group composed of the child from every other group in the class who was assigned their same topic. These “homogenous” groups share information and practice presentations of their topics. Finally, children reunite with their original groups, and each child teaches the material. A test on all the material generally follows. The Jigsaw method has repeatedly been found to improve learning as well as classroom social relations (Aronson, 2002; Bridgeman, 1981; Lazarowitz, Hertz-Lazarowitz, & Baird, 1994). In terms of academic achievement, it is particularly successful with minority youths, but in some cases it has improved, and in no cases (to my knowledge) has it negatively affected, the learning of other students (Lucker, Rosenfield, Sikes, & Aronson, 1977; Slavin, 1983).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

Ten- and 11-year-olds were assigned to one of four conditions, crossing “working in pairs/alone” with “encouraged to talk/not,” and asked to 212 Montessori solve puzzles, such as to determine how a spaceship moved or to decipher the effect of using a particular function key on a computer. Children who worked together and were encouraged to talk were most likely to solve the puzzles and produced the most interpretive talk. Even when children were alone and encouraged to talk to themselves, their use of interpretive talk was positively related to their ability to solve the puzzles. Descriptive talk, which is more characteristic of children in the kindergarten years, was associated with low levels of performance on the problem-solving tasks. The children who performed the worst were ones who worked alongside others but were discouraged from talking at all, which is the typical arrangement in traditional elementary schools. In contrast, children at these ages in Montessori schools tend to work together, and they frequently talk while they work. This study suggests that elementary school children particularly benefit from collaboration because by their ages children are apt to engage in the kind of discussion that advances understanding: interpretive talk.

For the other two conditions, children were simply allowed to draw with the markers for six minutes and then were unexpectedly given a Good Player Award, or they drew for six minutes and no award was ever mentioned.

Drawings done by children who expected rewards were judged as significantly lower in quality than drawings done in the other two conditions. This was the first finding. The second one was that a few weeks later, when the classroom was observed for marker use, children who had expected a reward used the markers much less than they had previously, and half as much as the other children.

All children read a passage, then were asked how much they enjoyed the passage, how difficult it was, and how pressured they felt. Then they were told they would read a second passage, with directions that varied by condition. Some children were told, ""After you are finished, I’m going to test you on it. I want to see how much you can remember. You should work as hard as you can, because I’ll be grading you on the test to see if you’re learning well enough."" Another group of children was told, ""After you are finished, I’ll be asking you some questions similar to the ones I just asked about the other passage."" Recall that these questions were about their personal reactions to the passages. After answering the questions about interest, pressure, and difficulty for the second reading, the children were asked to recall as much of the second 160 Montessori passage as they could. To test for conceptual learning, they were also asked to write an essay on the main point of the passage. To test long-term retention, a week later, children were asked to once again recall the second passage by rote and to write an essay describing the passage’s main point. The results were highly suggestive of what expectations about getting a grade do for learning. Students who thought they would be graded rendered the passage by rote best at the first test, but had also forgotten the most a week later, making their long-term retention equal to that of the children who thought they would be questioned only about their personal reactions. At second testing, the ""personal-reaction"" children retained almost all of the rote information reported at the first session. But rote learning is usually not what we really value, after all. Conceptual learning--drawing the main point from what we read--is much more important, and the results here are compelling. The essays of the students who did not expect a test or a grade showed significantly greater conceptual learning than did the essays of the children who did expect one. The upshot is that students who expect to be tested initially learn the facts better, by rote, but as soon as the test is over, they forget much of what they learned.

Correct solutions to the first 9 problems all involved a particular pattern of use of three jugs, but a correct solution to the 10th one involved just two jugs, so the 10th problem was a set breaker: it required that the participant break a response set to consider a problem in a new way. What was of interest was not whether problems were solved correctly, since that was expected, but instead how long it took to solve them, particularly the set breaker. Whereas participants in both groups took equally long on the initial 9 items, the set-breaking 10th problem took participants in the nonreward condition only about half as long to solve as the participants who were trying for the $1 bonus.

excerpt_1569,"One interesting study examined the impact of grades on self theories, goals, and performance in sixth-graders using tasks with both fixed and open-ended solutions (Butler & Nisan, 1986). Some of the fixed-solution tests were word games, such as making as many words as possible from the letters of a long word and constructing new words using the first and last letters of a prior word. The open-ended tasks included a ""creative uses"" task in which one comes up with as many uses as possible for an object, and a ""circles"" task, in which one is given a page of nickel-sized circles to draw on, and the creativity of one’s drawings is rated. All children performed similarly on a pre-test composed of these tasks. Two days later, some of the children were surprised by the return of their test booklets with either verbal feedback specifying how they could have performed better (""You wrote many short words, but not many long ones"") or a score. All of the children then engaged in slightly different versions of the same tasks. A third session two hours later repeated the original tasks, and children answered questions regarding their motivation on the tasks and the sources of their performance. An important factor to remember for the results of these experiments is that they were conducted in the children’s school classroom, in a manner reminiscent of school assignments. By sixth grade, students have learned that what one does in school is important only when there is evaluative extrinsic rewards and motivation 167 feedback. Unfortunately, university students often appear to feel the same way, visibly going on vacation when told something will not be on the exam. In keeping with this, students who had not gotten their test booklets back before the second session (no feedback) did not perform as well as the others on the later tests. They probably did not see the assignment as important and did not put in effort. Consistent with other studies, the two different kinds of feedback led to differences in performance on the open-ended tasks (not on the fixedsolution ones). For example, students who received verbal feedback about how to do better thought of more uses for objects later than did students who had received grades. In addition, students who received comments reported higher levels of motivation on and more liking for the tasks than did those who received grades. What was new about this study was that grades and comments also had different impacts on what the students felt contributed to their performance: their theories of intelligence. Students who received comments attributed their performance to effort, interest, and skill, whereas students who received grades were more apt to attribute their performance to the reader’s mood: an external, uncontrollable variable. If one has an incremental theory, skill is something one can control. The reader’s mood, on the other hand, is outside one’s control. The literature on learned helplessness and issues discussed in chapter 3 arise. As was discussed there, entity theorists tend to feel helpless in the face of failure. Attributions of effort aligned with these different perceptions of what underlay their performance. Students in the grades group attributed their effort to a desire to avoid failure, whereas those who received comments attributed their effort to their interest in the task. The entity theorists’ performance goals are thus apparent in the group who received grades. Grades and other evaluations, then, undermine motivation perhaps in part because they tend to lead to performance goals instead of mastery ones. Grades appear to lead children to view their level of performance as reflecting their being smart or dumb, not as indicative of having studied hard or not.",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,

For example, their teacher (mentioned by name) presented them with three Mars bars (their favorite candy) on their birthday, and if they cut each candy bar in half, how many friends could they share with? As bookends to these lessons, children took pre- and post-tests of their understanding of fractions. The results were clear in supporting that children learn best when the material is of personal interest. On the post-test, the abstract group scored lowest (averaging 2 of 11 problems correct), the concrete next-lowest (3.5 of 11), and the personalized group had the highest score (6 of 11).

The results showed that these students advanced dramatically in math, from the 30th to the 70th percentile, during the year of the intervention. The same teacher had used traditional methods (assigning problems from books, and not having students discuss them) the previous year with a similar group, and had seen no such advancement.

When paged, they filled out a form specifying their thoughts and activities at that moment. Three years later, the students’ progress in their talent areas was assessed. It was found that children’s achievement across the three years was directly related to the level of interest and excitement they expressed when engaged in the activity at the first time point.

This might be because of the more positive affect (Gasper & Clore, 2002).

Nine- to 11-year-olds were taught a computer math game, strangely titled (in the real world), ‘How the West Was One + Three x Four’ (Seiler, 1989) ... Children in the control condition saw the game in an unembellished, rather banal format, with the title of ‘Math Game.’ For the other children, the game was presented within a spaceship fantasy context and either had the title ‘Space Quest’ and involved the child imagining she or he was piloting a spaceship to other planets to save Earth from an energy crisis, or else had the title ‘Treasure Hunt,’ and involved imagining he or she was the captain of a ship seeking buried treasure. Some children also had personalized games that began with the child’s name (‘Best of luck in your journey, Commander Christy’) and sent the child off on the journey with his or her own personal favorite foods. Children played these games three times at school over a two-week period, for 30 minutes each time. A week later they were tested on their knowledge of the use of parentheses in arithmetic expressions as well as their knowledge of arithmetic operations in a different context. Their enjoyment of the game, their own assessment of their performance, and their desired level of challenge in future games were also assessed. The results were quite clear. When interesting contexts had been provided, children showed better knowledge of how parentheses affect arithmetic operations and were better able to transfer that knowledge to non-computer contexts. Personalization augmented these effects. In addition, students’ motivation was clearly influenced by the manipulation. Students in the context conditions were much more likely to opt for the computer playing its best game, liked the game more, were more willing to stay after school to play the game, believed themselves to be better at the games, and indicated they would seek a more challenging game later.

Autonomy scores were found to align significantly with their students’ judgments of the atmosphere in the classroom, suggesting good correspondence between how students see the teacher and what the teacher thinks is appropriate to do.

Such people view mistakes as learning opportunities, and when they err, they continue to engage in the task with the aim of mastering it. The second is a helpless pattern, in which people back down from challenges, opting for easier tasks instead.

excerpt_1590,"Dweck and her colleagues have shown that by implicitly endorsing one or the other theory, adults have a significant impact on children’s learning and well-being. One study examined the influence of different types of adult feedback on fifth-graders’ achievement goals, attributions, and performance (Mueller & Dweck, 1998). The researchers were particularly interested in how feedback about a child’s success would impact a child’s later response to failure, because of the common practice of praising children for their successes by telling them they are smart, good, and so on.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1591,"In the first experiment, children were given three sets of problems to solve. The first set was a moderately difficult one, so all the children did fairly well. At that point, all of the children were told, “Wow, you did very well on these problems.” No matter how they had actually done, all the children were told they had gotten 80% right. “That’s a really high score.” (Children were “debriefed” about the experiment later.) Then, roughly a third of the children were told, “You must be smart at these problems,” in effect giving them an entity or fixed-trait reason for their high score. A different third were told, “You must have worked hard at these problems,” implying an incremental theory of intelligence. The remaining children received no additional feedback. Presumably these children retain their native theory of intelligence, which in the general population is about 43% incremental and about 43% entity. (The rest do not fit clearly into either pattern.) Next, children were told they could do more problems, and were asked to choose what kind of problems they would like, as a measure of their achievement orientation. They were offered a choice of “Problems that aren’t too hard, so I don’t get many wrong,” “Problems that are pretty easy, so I’ll do well,” or “Problems that I’m pretty good at, so I can show that I’m smart” (p. 35). These first three options endorse performance goals and go along with an entity theory, spawning a desire to perform well in order to look intelligent. A fourth option endorsed a learning goal and thus an incremental theory: “Problems that I’ll learn a lot from even if I won’t look so smart.” After stating their preferred choice, children went on to instead do a second, more difficult set of problems that they were told the experimenter had previously chosen. Their own choices would be granted, the experimenter told them, if there was extra time at the end of the session. After completing the second set of problems, they were told they had performed a lot worse on it than on the first set. To check for the impact of the different kinds of success attribution feedback on response to this failure experience, children were next asked about their desire to take some more problems home with them, their enjoyment of the task, their perceptions about how they had done, and their attributions for how they had done. They were then given a third set of problems, which was moderately difficult, like the first set, to allow for an assessment of how the experimental intervention influenced performance. After this final task, all children were debriefed and told the second set of problems was much harder than the first, and was in fact designed for seventh-graders. The researchers ensured that all children felt proud of their performance before leaving the experiment. The results of this study are extremely interesting in terms of their implications for how rapidly children respond to feedback endorsing an entity or an incremental view. Regarding achievement motivation, 92% of the children who had received effort praise chose the learning goal after the first set of problems, by asking to receive additional problems that they would learn from. By comparison, just 8% of the children who had received the intelligence praise chose this option. The other 92% of the children who had received intelligence praise opted for problems that would be easy so they could look smart or do well. Among the children who had gotten no feedback, about half chose performance and half chose learning goals, in keeping with the baseline representation of entity and mastery theorists in the general U.S. population.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1592,"Children’s post-failure attributions after the second set of problems were also affected by the intervention. Those who had been praised for effort after the first problem set attributed their subsequent failure to diminished effort, whereas those who were praised for ability attributed their subsequent failure to lack of ability. Task enjoyment was also very much affected, with children who were praised for intelligence reporting less enjoyment of the task than children who were praised for effort. In terms of persistence, children praised for effort were more likely to want to take some additional problems home. Finally, performance on the third set of problems was also influenced by the intervention feedback after the first set. Children praised for effort did better on the third set of problems than they had on the first set, and children praised for intelligence performed worse. Children who had received no praise showed no change. Thus a single sentence of feedback attributing success to intelligence or effort was associated with a cascade of remarkably different reactions to a subsequent failure event. In five subsequent experiments, the researchers replicated and extended these basic findings. When people with an entity view of intelligence (enduring or induced by feedback) face failure, they attribute the failure to a fixed quality of the self. In the context of such an attribution, people avoid further challenge, instead seeking evidence that they are indeed smart. If brief experimenter feedback can have such a large impact on children, parent and teacher feedback, which continues over time and comes from people who are very important to a child, would be expected to have even more. As was discussed in chapter 5, even when teachers simply told children a test would show “how good you are in relation to other children your age,” children’s performance declined (Graham & Golan, 1991).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1593,"The studies just described show that a feedback event (or a short series of such events) can influence immediate reactions even in very young children.

In the absence of particular feedback manipulations, children’s responses to challenging situations has been shown to remain stable from kindergarten until fifth grade (Ziegert, Kistner, Castro, & Robertson, 2001), and there is no reason to believe they change thereafter. The research suggests that how adults talk to children about their accomplishments has a host of important consequences. Dweck (1999) describes many other interesting outcomes and considerations regarding these two theories of self as malleable or fixed. The fact that adult feedback appears to push children toward adopting one or the other such view is what is important to the ideas of this chapter.

Teachers were advised to have this sense about themselves, and to pass this sense on to children.

It means marking them from 0 to 10. How can a zero correct anyone’s defects?” (1967a, p. 245). Instead, Dr. Montessori counseled that correction comes from the child’s own observation of his mistakes in the outcome, and that the materials the child works with should make it obvious to the child when he has erred (see the discussion in chapter 5 on the Control of Error).",Montessori,Academic/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Dr. Montessori clearly valued intrinsic over performance reasons for one’s work: “If work comes from an inner source, it is much more intense and much more fruitful” (1989, p. 85). Whether Montessori children do have more of a mastery orientation toward schoolwork than do children in traditional school situations is a question for empirical study. Children in other nontraditional school systems clearly do (for example, Boaler, 1997; Boaler & Staples, 2003).

Within each classroom, in many schools children are also grouped by ability level for each subject (“tracked”). By learning in this manner, children are removed from other children who are at very different levels. Their learning occurs in a narrow ability band. This is convenient to a factory model, since factories operate most efficiently if all of the raw materials are uniform.

To see if they imitated the model’s actions, children were given the objects immediately and again after a one-week delay. Regardless of the delay time, children who had seen a slightly older peer model replicated a greater number of complex action sequences than did children exposed to an adult model, suggesting the peer elicited more imitation. This is a fascinating finding in need of replication. Because only one model was used for each condition, it is possible that some other difference in the models besides their peer/adult status was responsible for the result. We know, for example, that people are particularly apt to imitate those with whom they have better rapport (Bernieri, 1988), and perhaps children felt more rapport with the child for reasons other than age.

excerpt_1614,"Different patterns of child behavior characterize different attachment styles (Weinfield, Sroufe, Egeland, & Carlson, 1999) ... some babies appear to avoid the mother--they do not look her in the eye and seem determined to try to be independent. Other babies approach the mother but then push her away. These latter two patterns are characteristic of insecure attachment relationships, and children who display these forms of attachment fare less well over time.",Traditional,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1615,"As stated, long-term outcome studies favor the secure attachment style. For example, in one study, children whose attachment status had been classified when they were infants returned to the laboratory at 2 years of age to engage in some problem-solving tasks with their mothers. Children previously rated as securely attached were more competent problem solvers, were more persistent, showed more enthusiasm, and were also more compliant with their mothers (Matas, Arend, & Sroufe, 1978).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1616,"Another study had children return to the laboratory as 3-year-olds to engage in a competitive game with a stranger (Luetkenhaus, Grossmann, & Grossmann, 1985). Children who at 12 months had been classified as securely attached interacted more smoothly with the stranger than children previously classified as insecurely attached. When children were told they were not doing well in the game, securely attached children upped their efforts, whereas insecurely attached children decreased their efforts. After failing, securely attached children displayed sadness more openly, which child psychologists regard positively; internalizing or not showing one’s feelings is associated with such later problems as childhood depression.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1617,"Another study examined children’s attachment relations in infancy and their behavior in summer camp at ages 9 to 11 (Urban, Carlson, Egeland, & Sroufe, 1991). Children with insecure attachment histories were more likely to be rated as dependent on adults at camp. They formed fewer friendships and were less socially competent as well. ",Traditional,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1618,"Other studies have shown that even as they enter adulthood, people who were classified as securely attached infants have more friends, engage more actively with their peers, explore more, have higher self-esteem, and show more positive emotion than do adults with insecure attachment histories (Thompson, 1999; Weinfield et al., 1999). This is only a small sampling of an abundant literature showing that secure attachment in infancy predicts positive developmental outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1619,"The secure attachment construct has also been extended beyond its roots in infancy and applied to people’s representations of intimate relationships throughout the lifespan. The attachment Q-sort was developed to measure attachment security in the preschool and school years (Waters & Deane, 1985). For this measure, the child’s teacher or some other trained observer sorts preselected statements concerning a child’s possible profile into piles indicating whether the statements are more or less characteristic of the child. The statements are about such issues as how the child responds to fearful situations, the child’s predominant mood, and how often the child seeks proximity and comfort. Sort patterns are used to place children into the different attachment style categories, and these categories correspond closely with attachment classifications from the Strange Situation months or years earlier, and predict a similar range of developmental outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1620,"A measure used to assess attachment in adults is the Adult Attachment Interview, in which people are asked to describe their relationship with their parents (Bakermans-Kranenburg & Van Ijzendoorn, 1993; Hesse, 1999). Responses on this interview tend to be related to the interaction style of one’s current relationships (Treboux, Crowell, & Waters, 2004), to parenting behaviors (Adam, Gunnar, & Tanaka, 2004), and to one’s attachment classification as an infant. In one study, people who were tested in the Strange Situation as infants and as adults found that 72% of participants were classified with the convergent attachment styles at both time points (Waters, Merrick, Treboux, Crowell, & Albersheim, 2000). Thus, attachment is an enduring construct, applicable even beyond infancy.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1621,"Given the importance of the construct to predicting later competence and well-being, a pertinent question is what leads a child to have a particular type of relationship with the caregiver. Bowlby (1969) and Ainsworth (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) believed that an important antecedent factor in attachment style was adult sensitivity, and research has borne out that possibility (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Discussion following refers to maternal sensitivity because that was Ainsworth’s main concern, but the constructs seem to apply to any close caregiver. Important attachment relationships also of course develop with fathers (Grossmann et al., 2002), and they also appear to develop with day-care providers and teachers. Children growing up on Israeli kibbutzim become attached to their caregivers, and the quality of those relationships also predicts children’s outcomes (Oppenheim, Sagi, & Lamb, 1988). Children with a secure attachment to their kibbutz caregiver were later more goal directed and achievement oriented than were other children. This is consistent with work showing that American children’s relationships with their kindergarten teachers are related to their academic and behavioral outcomes through eighth grade (Hamre & Pianta, 2001).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1622,"Awareness requires that the mother be proximate to the infant so that she can perceive the infant’s signals. This aspect of attachment theory led to a concern beginning in the 1970s about whether babies placed in day care could become attached to their mothers. After many years of controversy, the recent National Study of Day Care, involving a representative sample of over 1,000 American children in a variety of day-care arrangements, has shown that use of day care has no significant impact on child-mother attachment relations (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). It is the mother’s awareness of signals when she is with the infant that appears to matter, and not that she is with the infant at all times. One might revise Ainsworth’s criteria for awareness, then, to read that the adult must be proximate to the infant for some reasonable amount of time, and when proximate, must be able to perceive the infant’s signals. A second aspect of awareness, besides proximity, is having a low perceiving threshold. The adult must notice the child’s signals.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1623,"The second major aspect of sensitivity for Ainsworth is accurate interpretation. Adults must interpret the babies’ signals for what they are, rather than distorting the signals in some way. Distortions could be caused by adults projecting their own needs on the infant, denying the infant’s needs because of their own needs, or any other biasing of the infant’s signals to accord with the adult’s own wishes and needs. Ainsworth noted that to overcome such proclivities, the adult must have self-insight. A second feature necessary to accurate interpretation, according to Ainsworth, is empathy. Adults who lack empathy, she said, would have detached, intellectual relations with babies instead of warm, sensitive ones. “A mother might be quite aware of and understand accurately the baby’s behavior and the circumstances leading to her baby’s distress or demands, but because she is unable to empathize with him -- unable to see things from the baby’s point to view--she may tease him back into good humor, mock him, laugh at him, or just ignore him” (Ainsworth, 1969, p. 2). Lack of empathy thus leads to inappropriate response.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1624,"Even correctly interpreted signals can be followed by inappropriate responses. The third main feature of sensitivity for Ainsworth is that the response to the perceived and accurately interpreted signal be an appropriate one. Ainsworth noted that in the first year, the appropriate response to the baby is almost always what the child “asks” for via his or her signals: pick the child up when the signal indicates a desire to be held, feed the child when the signal indicates hunger, and so on. After the first year, Ainsworth noted that doing exactly as the baby asks is no longer always the best response. As they get older, children increasingly need to adapt to the world, rather than always expecting the world to adapt to them. On the other hand, children also need to feel some sense of control or efficacy, as suggested by the research presented in chapter 3. Ainsworth advised that thebest response after age 1 is a compromise response that keeps the child’s long-range interests at heart.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1625,The final feature of sensitivity concerns timing of the response. Ainsworth noted that responses must be prompt to be effective. Adults who were devoted to a rigid feed or sleep schedule would be insensitive on this point. Responses need to be timed closely after the baby’s calls for attention for the baby to experience the efficacy of his or her actions.,Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1626,"Ainsworth’s theoretical ideas regarding sensitivity were compiled into a rating scale on which the sensitivity of primary caregivers to their children could be scored by trained observers watching mothers and children interact. Ainsworth’s original study of 23 mother-child pairs found a remarkably strong relationship between maternal sensitivity and child attachment classification (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Many studies have been done in the meantime, and the results are not as strong; some even fail to show a relationship. When results are inconsistent, the best response is a meta-analysis combining results across many studies. A recent meta-analysis of maternal sensitivity and attachment shows there is a relationship between the two factors, such that (in statistical terms) a child’s chances of being securely attached move from 38% if a mother is not sensitive to 62% if the mother is sensitive (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Because all scales and measures are prone to some degree of “measurement error,” the relationship in real terms might be stronger.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1627,"The issue of direction of effects naturally arises here. Perhaps the reason some mothers respond sensitively has to do with characteristics of the infant, and those infant characteristics lead to the later positive outcomes. In this view, the mother has no direct bearing on the child’s later outcomes. The obvious infant characteristic to consider is the child’s personality (or temperament), and studies have been done examining the relationship between child personality and attachment security (Vaughn & Bost, 1999). The upshot of these studies is that although personality predicts some aspects of behavior in the Strange Situation, it does not predict reunion behaviors, which are the most diagnostic of relationship quality.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1628,"One could still argue, however, that some aspect of the child is responsible for attachment classification. Experimental designs can address this. In fact, several intervention studies have been conducted, in which mothers were trained to respond more sensitively to their infants and changes in attachment classification following the intervention were examined. A recent meta-analysis of 88 intervention studies showed that short, focused interventions related to maternal sensitivity were effective both in making parents respond more sensitively to their infants and in changing infant attachment status (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van Ijzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). Such work strongly suggests that maternal sensitivity has a causal relationship to attachment classification.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1629,"Ainsworth’s rating scales were designed for observation of mothers with their infants. But a mother’s interaction style with a child evolves over time. Other research has looked at how parents of securely attached infants behave toward them somewhat later, as toddlers and preschoolers. One can view this as addressing how the sensitive pattern of responding adapts as children age. Mothers whose children were insecurely attached as infants tend to interact more intrusively with them in first and second grades (Egeland, Pianta, & O’Brien, 1993). Their interaction styles are more directive, such that they are more apt to tell their children exactly what to do. In contrast, parents of securely attached children tend not simply to tell the children what to do, but instead make suggestions, helping children to figure things out for themselves (Fagot, Gauvain, & Kavanagh, 1996; Frankel & Bates, 1990; Matas et al., 1978; Moss, 1992). They are closely involved, but nonintrusive. In Bruner’s (1975) terms, echoing Vygotsky, parents of securely attached children provide ideal scaffolds for children, structuring the environment such that children can internalize problem-solving strategies (see also Gauvain, 2001), whereas parents of insecurely attached children are more directive. Secure attachment styles in infancy are associated with parenting styles that evolve in positive ways as children get older.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1630,"Dr. Montessori advised that teachers show a degree of warmth and sensitivity that is reminiscent of the characteristics of parents whose children are securely attached. The focal period for forming attachment relationships (12 to 18 months) is of course usually prior to the age of entry into a Montessori classroom. Yet there is nothing to indicate that the adult behaviors associated with particular attachment styles cease to matter, and indeed those behaviors are consistent with literature suggesting optimal parenting practices for older children as well. As children get older, they still appear to need a safe haven and a secure base; they simply need it less often and feel comfortable venturing farther away.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1631,"Dr. Montessori saw the task of childhood as being to become increasingly independent, and the role of the adult as assisting children toward that independence. As is indicated in the quote above, Dr. Montessori maintained the teacher should serve as a safe haven whenever the child needs that. Yet when the child is ready to explore, the Montessori teacher was advised to be sensitive to the child’s need for increased independence, heeding the child’s call to “Help me to do it alone!” (Montessori, 1948/1976, p. 103).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1632,"To determine when a child needs a secure base, the Montessori teacher was advised to be very attentive to the children, with the observational acuity of a well-trained scientist. Indeed, Dr. Montessori (1917/1965) said, “The fundamental quality [teachers must possess was] a capacity for observation” (p. 130). Like the sensitive parents described by Ainsworth (1969), teachers’ thresholds for perceiving signals should be low. They should be trained to notice and correctly interpret the behavioral manifestations of the child’s inner state, in order to know what to do next. As is discussed later in the chapter with regard to teacher training, Dr. Montessori also advised teachers to develop self-understanding, so they do not misinterpret children’s signals in ways that align with their own needs.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1633,"When children are concentrating on work, Dr. Montessori held that they should be left alone, because during such moments, she believed, they are developing themselves. In chapter 3, I discussed the idea that concentration might be an engine of self-regulation, which is associated with many positive personality variables. Dr. Montessori saw concentration as the moment of self-development. Because of this theoretical stance, she held that teachers must watch for any concentrated purposeful movement, so as to let it go undisturbed; the child must be protected from stimuli that would break the concentration. For example, Dr. Montessori described an incident in which a child who had thus far been disorderly in school one day began to rearrange the furniture, with an expression of intense interest. The teacher was inclined to stop him, but Dr. Montessori saw his activity as coordinated toward a useful end, and manifesting that child’s first moments of concentration on purposeful activity in the classroom. According to Dr. Montessori, a sensitive teacher would leave a child alone in such actions, as long as the child was not disturbing others.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1634,"The Montessori teacher must also be sensitive to when the child is ready for something new, because “the brain always asks for work which becomes more complex” (Montessori, 1989, p. 89). After great concentration a child may need to rest or simply observe others (Montessori, 1989, p. 19), but at a certain point the child will be ready for more complex work. The teacher must be attuned to such moments, and give the child new work when the child is ready. Further, like parents of securely attached children in problem-solving situations, the Montessori teacher must structure the environment in such a way that children can make discoveries on their own. Telling children, as traditional teaching often involves, is associated with insecure attachment relationships.",Montessori,Cognitive/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Children must have “a teacher who looks on them with love and hope” (Montessori, 1989, p. 79). Yet at the same time, the adult’s ultimate control of the environment was clearly a high priority. The pitfalls of permissive adult attitudes were pointed out in her writing. “If freedom is understood as letting the children do as they like, using or more likely misusing, the things available, it is clear that only their ‘deviations’ are free to develop” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 206). Permissive parents are often thought of as ones who want to be their children’s friends; it is hard for them to exercise authority. Dr. Montessori saw the dangers in this: “The teacher must be superior and not just a friend. . . . [Children] need a dignified, mature person. . . . If they have no authority, they have no directive. Children need this support” (1989, p. 17). Some Montessori teachers, like some parents, err in this regard. They do not provide ultimate control over the environment, deal effectively with unproductive behaviors, or guide children’s decisions in positive ways. Freedom can thus be taken to an extreme, and Dr. Montessori counseled against this repeatedly. “One time I saw an entire class of disorganized children who were using the materials completely wrongly. The teacher drifted about in the class, silent as the Sphinx. . . . This teacher was committing a grave error: She feared disturbing their disorder, instead of attempting to establish the order” (Montessori, 1956, p. 140).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1662,"Another not uncommon error in Montessori teaching is the opposite one: for teachers to be overly rigid about the method, in a manner reminiscent of authoritarian parents. Dr. Montessori also spoke against an authoritarian stance: “The teacher can address the pupil energetically and severely and thus jolt him out of his behavior, but those who know their jobs well have means more effective than coercion for recalling the pupil to order” (1956, p. 141). Authoritarian parents tell children to do things because the parent says so; they do not reason with the child, and they appear to take on a stance that they are infallible. Yet adults who work with children have to admit to being fallible (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246). Education, she said, was traditionally “directed toward the suppression or bending of the child’s will, and the substitution for it of the teacher’s will, which demands from the child unquestioning obedience” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 252). Against the behaviorist trend, she said, “We cannot directly mold. . . . individual forms of character, intelligence, and feeling” (1917/1965, p. 9).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1663,"The degree to which Montessori teachers take an authoritative stance, and whether their degree of authoritativeness is associated with more optimal academic, social, and personal outcomes, are important issues for empirical research. Dr. Montessori’s ideas about how teachers should behave toward children were clearly in line with today’s research on parenting styles. They should provide an appropriately structured environment in which children are free to make their own decisions and discoveries. They should intervene only when children’s behavior is not constructive. They should have high expectations and give reasons, all with warm love.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1664,"The fact that teachers get reputations that hold across the years suggests that teacher orientations are more stable, but a wealth of research in psychology also shows that people are much more influenced by the situation they are in than we sometimes expect (Ross & Nisbett, 1991). Still, my guess is that a new class of children in the same school would not strongly affect a teacher’s responses and that teachers were the main causal factor in children’s responses. In addition, in chapter 3 I mentioned a study in which teachers were trained to give children more control in the classroom, and positive changes were observed in their students (De Charms, 1976).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1665,"The study of teacher responses and child outcomes mentioned earlier in this section was replicated in Russia and revealed the same basic pattern of results. Unfortunately, as children get older in traditional American schools, the schools increasingly take away, rather than increase, children’s autonomy. Research in psychology has shown that when teachers have independence goals for children, children tend to have more intrinsic motivation to learn, and also to be higher in self-esteem.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1666,"The current swing toward external testing standards promotes the opposite behaviors in teachers. In one study, when teachers were told their students would have to pass specific educational standards, teachers became more controlling, talked and commanded more, gave students less choice and autonomy, and expressed more criticism of students (Deci, Spiefel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kaufman, 1982). Both as children get older, and when standardized testing is emphasized, teachers in traditional schools become more prone to create classroom environments that are at odds with more optimal child outcomes. In the context of traditional education, teachers can attempt to overcome the negative effects of grades and testing, and the inherently competitive, comparative system they create. The system, however, was designed for their use, and as the current enthusiasm for high-stakes testing shows, as a culture we keep returning to it.

First, as was discussed with reference to authoritative parenting, Montessori teachers’ expectations are high. Children are expected to achieve a good deal both academically and socially in Montessori classrooms. They achieve this in part by their own self-control. The Montessori teacher’s goal is clearly the child’s self-regulation; the teacher’s task was well done when the teacher was needed only to give additional lessons. “Any pedagogical action, if it is to be efficacious in the training of little children, must tend to help the children to advance upon this road of independence” (Montessori, 1912/1964, p. 97).

Before concentration occurs, the directress may do more or less what she thinks best; she may interfere with the children’s activities as much as she thinks necessary” (1967a, p. 278).

excerpt_1673,"If concentration leads to better self-regulation, as research presented in chapter 3 suggests it does, then teachers are probably most apt to see misbehavior in newly established Montessori classrooms, before children have begun to concentrate (although of course misbehavior might surface anytime!). Dr. Montessori was quite clear that any disruptive or socially unacceptable behavior should always be checked. She recommended doing so by redirection rather than punishment. “Interfere by all means to stop disturbances, but we need not punish or scold or admonish when we stop bad behavior; we can ask the child to come and pick flowers in the garden or offer a toy or any occupation that will appeal to [the child]” (Montessori, 1989, p. 16).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

In this manner Dr. Montessori seemed to be endorsing authoritative parenting: high warmth and high control.

excerpt_1675,"Eventually, as a new classroom settles, children will one by one begin to concentrate. She suggested that once children have begun to concentrate, the adult step back. She often described the adult’s role at this point, once children have begun to concentrate, as passive, but she clearly meant a very attentive sort of passivity. “Passive” apparently only referred to the idea that the adult not interfere with the child’s concentration. She stated that adults often err by praising children who are concentrating, or by correcting their errors. Both, she said, lead children to abandon their work in moments of concentration.

The claim that calling a child “good” is a form of betrayal suggests she would not condone person praise, but leaves open whether she would condone product or process praise or both. When a child comes to an adult seeking praise, she said, then the child needs praise as assurance that he or she is on the right track (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 88).

excerpt_1680,"An ability to observe children and detect their needs is fundamental to good Montessori teaching. Dr. Montessori maintained that the capacity to observe children has to be carefully developed through long practice (1917/1965, p. 130). In the AMI Montessori teacher training courses, scores of hours are spent with children, observing their actions, recording those observations, and crafting them into reports to be reviewed by the teacher trainer. Dr. Montessori advocated training in science, rather than in education, for people who would go into Montessori teaching, in part because training in science is training in close observation (Montessori, 1917/1965, p. 138). She was also concerned that training in traditional education might make it more difficult to become a good Montessori teacher. “An ordinary teacher cannot be transformed into a Montessori teacher, but must be created anew, having rid herself of pedagogical prejudices” (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 87).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

This is reminiscent of Ainsworth’s discussion of sensitivity, in which the sensitive mother is free from distortions caused by her own needs and desires, a state that aids her in seeing the child’s signals for what they are. This emphasis on one’s personal preparation to be a teacher contrasts sharply with traditional teacher training, which focuses more on how one does things than on one’s own psychology. In fact, the Montessori approach is more in keeping with training psychoanalysts, since they must go through analysis themselves first.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1682,"To teach about the material and its presentation, AMI teacher training generally requires nine months of lecture with internships in a variety of Montessori classrooms and observation time intermingled.

Lectures and practicums enable trainees to learn about the materials and the variety of ways in which they can be used to stimulate interest and use, as well as the interconnections between materials across the curriculum. Trainees learn to present the materials, with all the variations, to children (by practicing on the trainer and fellow trainees prior to internships).",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Effectively, the Montessori teacher-in-training writes his or her own textbook concerning Montessori materials and theory. The knowledge in these albums is of course not as deep and thorough as that of the teacher trainer, just as the notes of a student taking a college course would not reflect all the knowledge of the professor, but they are sufficiently thorough to allow the teacher to refer to them over the coming years, and to guide his or her lessons in the future. Some other Montessori teacher training courses routinely give teachers copies of the information rather than having them write and illustrate it themselves. This is not a good change: research has shown that taking one’s own notes leads to better learning than does reading prewritten ones (Annis, 1981; Kulhavy, Dyer, & Silver, 1975).",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

The mathematical concept of squares is inherent in the materials, as it would take four of the first prism to make the second, nine of the first to make the third, and so on.

The shortest one is 10 cm long, and each successive one is 10 cm longer than the previous one, so the longest rod is 100 cm. One Montessori teacher observed to me that some children do not appear even to see the difference in these lengths at first, but must learn to perceive the difference. The teacher assists the child’s learning by showing the child how widely one has to stretch one’s arms to hold the longest one versus a shorter one, how the rods differ in weight, and so on. With the help of their bodies, children learn to perceive the differences in the Red Rods and to line them up from shortest to longest.

The structural organization involved was a diorama of a miniature town, into which 20 small items, including animals, cars, people, and so on, were logically placed while the children, Maya and American 8- and 9-year-olds, looked on. The 20 objects were then replaced into the pool of 80 items from which they were drawn, and the children were asked to reconstruct the scene. Although the Maya sample had shown much poorer memory previously on a standard list task, their performance was even slightly better than that of the American children in this organized task. Although children learn to memorize lists of unrelated items in Traditional schools, one might question whether this is a good use of their processing resources.Transitive inference tasks are ones in which one learns that A > B and B > C, and one must infer that A > C. When the stimuli from which children made inferences were arranged in a physical order that mirrored their conceptual relations, children made correct inferences significantly more often than when the stimuli were arranged randomly.

excerpt_1845,"She also made interesting observations about how children play hiding games that pertain to order. Dr. Montessori recounted that Piaget once played a hiding game with one of his children, hiding an object under a pillow, having his child leave the room, moving the object to another pillow, and then asking the child to find it. When the child did not see the object under the first pillow, the child gave up. Piaget then showed the child how he had moved the object, and repeated the procedure. The child behaved in exactly the same way, whereupon Piaget lifted the second pillow and asked, ""Didn’t you see I put it here?"" (on the prior hiding trial). ""Yes,"" his child replied, ""but it should be there"" (pointing to the first pillow) (Montessori, 1966, pp. 53–54). Although to Piaget this task was probably about inference, to Dr. Montessori the incident was about the child’s need to find the object in its proper place. She also noted that children often play hide-and-seek by hiding in the same place over and over, or in the place where the last hider was just found. She saw this as also reflecting a need for order, for there being set places and times for objects and events.

Vygotsky argued that learning occurs in a zone of proximal development, meaning over tasks one cannot yet accomplish alone but can accomplish in the company of a more advanced other. In his view, slightly advanced peers serve as important leaders of development (Hogan & Tudge, 1999; Vygotsky, 1978).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1854,". In the early 1960s, the psychologist Albert Bandura provided the classic evidence that learning can occur through observation and imitation (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963). Bandura showed children films of an adult hitting a wobbly blow-up “Bobo” doll and noted that children were later apt to behave toward the doll as the adult had. According to behaviorists, such learning should not have occurred, because children were not rewarded directly for the behaviors they later enacted. The studies made the point that learning can occur by simply watching what others do, irrespective of personal rewards. Along with other important developments at the time, Bandura’s work helped to turn the dominant paradigm of American psychology from behaviorism to cognitive science",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1855,"Dr. Montessori described an early case in which it became apparent to her that children’s tendency to imitate others can be a useful source of inlearning from peers 197 spiration in school, advancing children to new abilities. This observation, called the “explosion” into writing, recurs annually in well-functioning Montessori Primary classrooms when the first 4-year-old suddenly realizes, after months of working with the preparatory materials, that he or she can write. “The first word to be written by one of them brought a great outburst of joy and laughter. Everyone looked admiringly at ‘the writer,’ and thus they felt moved to follow his example. ‘I can do it too!’ they cried. The achievement of one started off the whole group” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 231). Other 4-year-olds, having also been indirectly prepared to write through the use of knobs on Wooden Cylinders and other materials, pencils in Metal Insets, and so on, as was described in chapter 1, spontaneously began writing in reaction to having observed a first child reaching that landmark. Obviously children also see others learn to write in traditional schools; what is unique in Montessori is the series of steps, all visible and imitable, that lead children along the path to writing, so that a community of 4-year-olds can discover they already have the ability to write once they see it done by another child.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1856,"Children also can learn about social behavior in Montessori classrooms by observing how others behave in natural, nonscripted situations. Whereas in traditional classrooms, children learn how to sit still and listen to the teacher, in Montessori, they can learn how to interact with each other. The oldest children in the classroom can serve as examples to the younger ones. “The undisciplined child enters into discipline by working in the company of others, not by being told that he is naughty” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246).",Montessori,Social,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1857,". Dr. Montessori also noted that by observing older children, younger ones can see what they will later be able to do themselves, and that this is motivating. “To understand what the older ones are doing fills the little ones with enthusiasm” (1967a, p. 228).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1858,"One might wonder how learning by observation in a Montessori classroom is possible for the oldest children, who are working at the highest levels with many of the available materials. Facilitating their learning by observation, Dr. Montessori urged that children be allowed to visit other classrooms. “The classroom for those of three to six is not even rigidly separated from that of the children from seven to nine. Thus, children of six can get ideas from the class above. . . . One can always go for an intellectual walk!” (1967a, p 227).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_1861,"One study of the efficacy of such a system (“Classwide Peer Tutoring”) involved first- and second-grade classrooms in low-income schools (Greenwood et al., 1987). Classrooms were randomly assigned to tutoring and control conditions for spelling. In control classrooms, teachers used standard methods of teaching spelling: a workbook with word lists and vocabulary exercises, chalkboard, self-study, and homework assignments. In classrooms that used the tutoring program, the tutoring process described earlier replaced some in-class spelling work. Over the two years of the study, children in the peer tutoring classrooms were spelling 87% of the words correctly on average, whereas children in other classrooms were spelling 75% of words correctly. This is not an enormous difference, but it is certainly a meaningful one. Peering tutoring programs also appear to confer many social benefits on the classroom (Fantuzzo, Riggio, Connelly, & Dimeff, 1989; Maheady & Sainato, 1985). In addition, they apparently benefit learning other topics and over the long term",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1862,"In one demonstration of these benefits, a follow-up study expanded the peer tutoring to cover reading, math, and language, and examined children’s performance over multiple years. Children in the tutoring program performed significantly better than those in the control group on all three topics both immediately and two years later, when they had moved on to middle school and no longer had the program. They also performed better in two nontutored topics: science and social studies. They even performed as well as children in a higher SES group in all these areas (Greenwood et al., 1989). In addition, fewer children from the peer tutoring group were placed in special-education classes (Greenwood, Terry, Utley, Montagna, & Walker, 1993). This study is among many suggesting that peer tutoring programs, appropriately structured, improve learning in traditional schools and that the benefits extend across time and topics (see Topping & Ehly, 1998).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1863,"Peer tutoring programs vary in terms of how structured each tutoring session is, and more structured programs are typically associated with greater success. Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) is an example of a more structured tutoring program (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998), and it has also been used to examine the effect of rewards. RPT begins with training sessions about teamwork and cooperation, and children are told they can win rewards by using teamwork. In the RPT program, teaching aides show the children how to tutor each other. Then RPT sessions are held twice weekly for 45 minutes each. Special flash-card materials are used, with a problem on one side and steps to the solution on the other. Children decide who will be tutor first in each session, and work for 10 minutes on problems before switching roles. After the initial 20 minutes, problem drill sheets are administered, and students attempt the problems, then switch papers with partners for correction. Performance on the drill sheets accrues points, which lead to such rewards as being teacher’s helper or working on a special project. When children were randomly assigned to RPT versus traditional instruction groups, those in the RPT groups consistently showed higher levels of mathematics achievement (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998). Two alternative groups were also formed, one with the reward but lacking the structure provided by the flash cards, and the other having the structure but no reward. The combination of rewards and structure led to the most gains in both achievement and positive social behavior. Structure alone, without rewards, was associated with better behavior both in the tutoring sessions and in the regular classroom situation. Students also perceived themselves to be more competent when using structured than when using unstructured tutoring, but achievement was not improved in the absence of rewards (Fantuzzo, King, & Heller, 1992). Thus, within a traditional school environment, more structured peer interactions with a reward structure optimized learning and behavior. The issue of rewards is important and is discussed further in the context of collaborative learning.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1864,"Although supplementing whole-class teaching with peer tutoring improves achievement, adults are even more effective tutors than peers. The research suggests several reasons for this that shed light on how peer tutoring can be most effective. First, adults structure the task in ways that keep the overarching goal in clear focus, whereas child partners tend to focus on parts of the problem, losing sight of the whole--a difference reminiscent of the differences between same-age experts and novices. For example, if the task is planning a route for doing a set of errands as efficiently as possible, child pairs will get the errands done, but not as efficiently, because they focus on each individual item to be retrieved separately, rather than thinking about how several items can be grouped to make for more efficient routes. Adult tutors get children to think about grouping items. However, when the peer tutor is trained in this task and taught to consider how to group items, tutee performance does improve. Nonetheless, performance even with a trained peer tutor does not improve to the level obtained when the tutor was an adult (Gauvain, 2001).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1865,"A second probable reason for the greater success of adult tutors is that adults tend to include children more in the task at hand. Other children can become autocratic, as children are inclined to focus on who gets to do what. Children tend to like to do; adults more easily sit back, watch, and guide. Research has shown that peer learning is also more successful when peers listen to each other and question each other more (reviewed below), skills that many adults have but many children have not yet learned (Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1866,"Perhaps in part because peer tutors can become autocratic, some research suggests that, when tutored by a peer, the tutee benefits maximally from a peer who is just a bit more advanced rather than much more advanced. For example, research on both scientific and moral reasoning has shown that children benefit from exposure to thought processes that are just above their current level (Damon & Killen, 1982; Kuhn, 1972; Turiel & Rothman, 1972)",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1867,"Besides being less able to adapt to a lower level of tutee, much older and more advanced peer tutors sometimes practice social dominance. The problems of autocracy mentioned earlier thus become exacerbated, and the tutee learns less, because he or she is less involved in the decision-making process. This was found in a study in which 5-year-old novices were paired either with 5- or 7-year-olds who were considered experts at planning routes (as in the study just described) (Duran & Gauvain, 1993). Children were more involved with the task when paired with an advanced planner of their own age, as opposed to an older planner, and this increased involvement predicted better performance. Whether the particular age gap used in this experiment (5 to 7) is a particularly problematic one would be an interesting topic for research. The age of 6 is a pivotal one, recognized in many of the world’s cultures as an appropriate time to ask more of children, such as by beginning formal schooling (Rogoff, 1981). Six is the age at which Piaget speculated children advance to being able to perform mental operations (for example, imagining addition and subtraction), and which Dr. Montessori considered transitional between her first and second planes of development. At each plane, she said, children think differently. Examining whether 6- and 8-, or 7- and 9-year-olds, make more effective tutoring pairs would be of interest. The research suggests that peers who are slightly advanced, but not too advanced, make more optimal tutors, but it might also be the case that tutors who are within particular age spans are best",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

After hearing the first story, children who did not solve it spontaneously (about 80% of them) were shown the solution. The second story was about a man who needed to get hay bales on a high tractor--a problem that could also be solved by stacking items. Some children were simply told the story, whereas others were asked to teach the solution to a Kermit the Frog puppet.

He reasoned that close student contact, for the purpose of helping others, might alleviate problems, and so created learning arrangements that would lead to such contact. In the Jigsaw model, children are placed in groups of five or six and topics of study are broken into as many segments. For the topic of the Civil War, for example, one person might be assigned to study the history of slavery, another the type of weapons used in the era, another the major battles, 210 Montessori and so on. Children research their topic on their own, and then temporarily join a new group composed of the child from every other group in the class who was assigned their same topic. These “homogenous” groups share information and practice presentations of their topics. Finally, children reunite with their original groups, and each child teaches the material. A test on all the material generally follows. The Jigsaw method has repeatedly been found to improve learning as well as classroom social relations (Aronson, 2002; Bridgeman, 1981; Lazarowitz, Hertz-Lazarowitz, & Baird, 1994). In terms of academic achievement, it is particularly successful with minority youths, but in some cases it has improved, and in no cases (to my knowledge) has it negatively affected, the learning of other students (Lucker, Rosenfield, Sikes, & Aronson, 1977; Slavin, 1983).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

Children who worked together and were encouraged to talk were most likely to solve the puzzles and produced the most interpretive talk. Even when children were alone and encouraged to talk to themselves, their use of interpretive talk was positively related to their ability to solve the puzzles. Descriptive talk, which is more characteristic of children in the kindergarten years, was associated with low levels of performance on the problem-solving tasks. The children who performed the worst were ones who worked alongside others but were discouraged from talking at all, which is the typical arrangement in traditional elementary schools. In contrast, children at these ages in Montessori schools tend to work together, and they frequently talk while they work.

Heavy marker users were then brought, one at a time, to a testing room, and a third of them were immediately shown a ""Good Player Award""--a fancy note card with a big gold star and a red ribbon. They were asked if they would like to receive a Good Player Award, and all the children assented. They were told that all they had to do to win the award was draw with the markers. After each child had drawn for six minutes, a Good Player Award was placed with great fanfare on an ""Honor Roll Board."" For the other two conditions, children were simply allowed to draw with the markers for six minutes and then were unexpectedly given a Good Player Award, or they drew for six minutes and no award was ever mentioned. A panel of judges who were blind to what condition the children had been in rated the drawings’ creativity. Drawings done by children who expected rewards were judged as significantly lower in quality than drawings done in the other two conditions. This was the first finding. The second one was that a few weeks later, when the classroom was observed for marker use, children who had expected a reward used the markers much less than they had previously, and half as much as the other children.

Eight undergraduates who wrote headlines for a college newspaper participated, and their average time for writing a headline was measured. For the reward condition, four of the headline writers were offered 50 cents per headline written over a three-week period. The average time each participant took to write headlines during the three weeks before the reward period was compared with their time during the three weeks after the reward period.

All children read a passage, then were asked how much they enjoyed the passage, how difficult it was, and how pressured they felt. Then they were told they would read a second passage, with directions that varied by condition. Some children were told, ""After you are finished, I’m going to test you on it. I want to see how much you can remember. You should work as hard as you can, because I’ll be grading you on the test to see if you’re learning well enough."" Another group of children was told, ""After you are finished, I’ll be asking you some questions similar to the ones I just asked about the other passage."" Recall that these questions were about their personal reactions to the passages. After answering the questions about interest, pressure, and difficulty for the second reading, the children were asked to recall as much of the second 160 Montessori passage as they could. To test for conceptual learning, they were also asked to write an essay on the main point of the passage. To test long-term retention, a week later, children were asked to once again recall the second passage by rote and to write an essay describing the passage’s main point. The results were highly suggestive of what expectations about getting a grade do for learning. Students who thought they would be graded rendered the passage by rote best at the first test, but had also forgotten the most a week later, making their long-term retention equal to that of the children who thought they would be questioned only about their personal reactions. At second testing, the ""personal-reaction"" children retained almost all of the rote information reported at the first session. But rote learning is usually not what we really value, after all. Conceptual learning--drawing the main point from what we read--is much more important, and the results here are compelling. The essays of the students who did not expect a test or a grade showed significantly greater conceptual learning than did the essays of the children who did expect one. The upshot is that students who expect to be tested initially learn the facts better, by rote, but as soon as the test is over, they forget much of what they learned.

How can the boy get exactly 3 quarts of water using only these containers and not guessing at the amount?"" (p. 287). Half were told that they would receive a nickel for each correct solution, and a $1 bonus if all 10 solutions were correct. Correct solutions to the first 9 problems all involved a particular pattern of use of three jugs, but a correct solution to the 10th one involved just two jugs, so the 10th problem was a set breaker: it required that the participant break a response set to consider a problem in a new way. What was of interest was not whether problems were solved correctly, since that was expected, but instead how long it took to solve them, particularly the set breaker. Whereas participants in both groups took equally long on the initial 9 items, the set-breaking 10th problem took participants in the nonreward condition only about half as long to solve as the participants who were trying for the $1 bonus.

To cement this promise, they signed an elaborate vow to later write the story. Other children also took two pictures before writing their story, but it was not construed as an advance reward. A second manipulation was that for half of the children in each group, the activities were labeled play, and for half they were labeled work. The researchers expected that the play label would be associated with higher creativity. The results indicated no significant effect of the work or play label on creativity, but a significant effect of how the picture taking was construed.

A second opportunity to sort papers arose later, while waiting for the experimenter to find a tape recorder. During this time, other activities such as reading comic books were also available. Children’s mothers also contributed to the data by describing how they used rewards for their children’s behaviors at home and how prosocial their children were. Children in the reward condition spent significantly less time sorting paper during the second, free-choice period than did children who did not receive a reward. Therefore motivation to subsequently engage in prosocial acts was negatively impacted by a prior expected reward. A particularly interesting finding is the relationship between mothers’ habitual use of rewards and children’s responses. Children whose mothers reported that they liked and used extrinsic rewards at home were most affected by the reward manipulation. They sorted significantly less paper, on average, and fewer than half of them sorted any paper at all at the second opportunity. Children whose mothers did not use rewards at home were much less impacted by rewards, and 85% of them helped by sorting paper.

excerpt_1908,"One interesting study examined the impact of grades on self theories, goals, and performance in sixth-graders using tasks with both fixed and open-ended solutions (Butler & Nisan, 1986). Some of the fixed-solution tests were word games, such as making as many words as possible from the letters of a long word and constructing new words using the first and last letters of a prior word. The open-ended tasks included a ""creative uses"" task in which one comes up with as many uses as possible for an object, and a ""circles"" task, in which one is given a page of nickel-sized circles to draw on, and the creativity of one’s drawings is rated. All children performed similarly on a pre-test composed of these tasks. Two days later, some of the children were surprised by the return of their test booklets with either verbal feedback specifying how they could have performed better (""You wrote many short words, but not many long ones"") or a score. All of the children then engaged in slightly different versions of the same tasks. A third session two hours later repeated the original tasks, and children answered questions regarding their motivation on the tasks and the sources of their performance. An important factor to remember for the results of these experiments is that they were conducted in the children’s school classroom, in a manner reminiscent of school assignments. By sixth grade, students have learned that what one does in school is important only when there is evaluative extrinsic rewards and motivation 167 feedback. Unfortunately, university students often appear to feel the same way, visibly going on vacation when told something will not be on the exam. In keeping with this, students who had not gotten their test booklets back before the second session (no feedback) did not perform as well as the others on the later tests. They probably did not see the assignment as important and did not put in effort. Consistent with other studies, the two different kinds of feedback led to differences in performance on the open-ended tasks (not on the fixedsolution ones). For example, students who received verbal feedback about how to do better thought of more uses for objects later than did students who had received grades. In addition, students who received comments reported higher levels of motivation on and more liking for the tasks than did those who received grades. What was new about this study was that grades and comments also had different impacts on what the students felt contributed to their performance: their theories of intelligence. Students who received comments attributed their performance to effort, interest, and skill, whereas students who received grades were more apt to attribute their performance to the reader’s mood: an external, uncontrollable variable. If one has an incremental theory, skill is something one can control. The reader’s mood, on the other hand, is outside one’s control. The literature on learned helplessness and issues discussed in chapter 3 arise. As was discussed there, entity theorists tend to feel helpless in the face of failure. Attributions of effort aligned with these different perceptions of what underlay their performance. Students in the grades group attributed their effort to a desire to avoid failure, whereas those who received comments attributed their effort to their interest in the task. The entity theorists’ performance goals are thus apparent in the group who received grades. Grades and other evaluations, then, undermine motivation perhaps in part because they tend to lead to performance goals instead of mastery ones. Grades appear to lead children to view their level of performance as reflecting their being smart or dumb, not as indicative of having studied hard or not.",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,

For example, one item read, ""There are three objects. Each is cut in one-half. In all, how many pieces would there be?"" (p. 73). The concrete group received hypothetical but concrete referents, for example stating that Bill had three candy bars, each of which he cut in half. The third group had examples that were intended to be most interesting, because they were personalized to concern matters of subjective importance, such as one’s birthday, teachers and friends, hobbies, and so on. For example, their teacher (mentioned by name) presented them with three Mars bars (their favorite candy) on their birthday, and if they cut each candy bar in half, how many friends could they share with? As bookends to these lessons, children took pre- and post-tests of their understanding of fractions. The results were clear in supporting that children learn best when the material is of personal interest.

Children in the control condition saw the game in an unembellished, rather banal format, with the title of ‘Math Game.’ For the other children, the game was presented within a spaceship fantasy context and either had the title ‘Space Quest’ and involved the child imagining she or he was piloting a spaceship to other planets to save Earth from an energy crisis, or else had the title ‘Treasure Hunt,’ and involved imagining he or she was the captain of a ship seeking buried treasure. Some children also had personalized games that began with the child’s name (‘Best of luck in your journey, Commander Christy’) and sent the child off on the journey with his or her own personal favorite foods. Children played these games three times at school over a two-week period, for 30 minutes each time. A week later they were tested on their knowledge of the use of parentheses in arithmetic expressions as well as their knowledge of arithmetic operations in a different context. Their enjoyment of the game, their own assessment of their performance, and their desired level of challenge in future games were also assessed. The results were quite clear. When interesting contexts had been provided, children showed better knowledge of how parentheses affect arithmetic operations and were better able to transfer that knowledge to non-computer contexts. Personalization augmented these effects. In addition, students’ motivation was clearly influenced by the manipulation. Students in the context conditions were much more likely to opt for the computer playing its best game, liked the game more, were more willing to stay after school to play the game, believed themselves to be better at the games, and indicated they would seek a more challenging game later.

In one study showing this, teachers were shown a set of vignettes such as the following: Jim is an average student who has been working at grade level… Teachers’ responses resulted in scores for the degree to which they promoted autonomy in the classroom. Autonomy scores were found to align significantly with their students’ judgments of the atmosphere in the classroom, suggesting good correspondence between how students see the teacher and what the teacher thinks is appropriate to do.

As was mentioned in chapter 5, people’s responses to challenges can be seen as fitting into two basic categories (Dweck, 1999). One is mastery oriented: people aim to overcome the challenges. Such people view mistakes as learning opportunities, and when they err, they continue to engage in the task with the aim of mastering it. The second is a helpless pattern, in which people back down from challenges, opting for easier tasks instead. They tend to view mistakes as reflections of some permanent defect of their character, and thus they seek to avoid tasks that will cast themselves in a negative light.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

The helpless pattern goes along with a theory of intelligence as a fixed entity, and the mastery pattern goes along with a theory of intelligence as malleable. Chapter 5 discussed studies indicating that grading appears to push people to adopt the performance goals that go with an entity theory of intelligence and choose activities that will indicate that they are highly intelligent. By contrast, mastery-oriented responses promote choosing of tasks that help one learn, which inspire one to master challenging tasks (Dweck, 1999).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1929,"Dweck and her colleagues have shown that by implicitly endorsing one or the other theory, adults have a significant impact on children’s learning and well-being. One study examined the influence of different types of adult feedback on fifth-graders’ achievement goals, attributions, and performance (Mueller & Dweck, 1998). The researchers were particularly interested in how feedback about a child’s success would impact a child’s later response to failure, because of the common practice of praising children for their successes by telling them they are smart, good, and so on.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1930,"In the first experiment, children were given three sets of problems to solve. The first set was a moderately difficult one, so all the children did fairly well. At that point, all of the children were told, “Wow, you did very well on these problems.” No matter how they had actually done, all the children were told they had gotten 80% right. “That’s a really high score.” (Children were “debriefed” about the experiment later.) Then, roughly a third of the children were told, “You must be smart at these problems,” in effect giving them an entity or fixed-trait reason for their high score. A different third were told, “You must have worked hard at these problems,” implying an incremental theory of intelligence. The remaining children received no additional feedback. Presumably these children retain their native theory of intelligence, which in the general population is about 43% incremental and about 43% entity. (The rest do not fit clearly into either pattern.) Next, children were told they could do more problems, and were asked to choose what kind of problems they would like, as a measure of their achievement orientation. They were offered a choice of “Problems that aren’t too hard, so I don’t get many wrong,” “Problems that are pretty easy, so I’ll do well,” or “Problems that I’m pretty good at, so I can show that I’m smart” (p. 35). These first three options endorse performance goals and go along with an entity theory, spawning a desire to perform well in order to look intelligent. A fourth option endorsed a learning goal and thus an incremental theory: “Problems that I’ll learn a lot from even if I won’t look so smart.” After stating their preferred choice, children went on to instead do a second, more difficult set of problems that they were told the experimenter had previously chosen. Their own choices would be granted, the experimenter told them, if there was extra time at the end of the session. After completing the second set of problems, they were told they had performed a lot worse on it than on the first set. To check for the impact of the different kinds of success attribution feedback on response to this failure experience, children were next asked about their desire to take some more problems home with them, their enjoyment of the task, their perceptions about how they had done, and their attributions for how they had done. They were then given a third set of problems, which was moderately difficult, like the first set, to allow for an assessment of how the experimental intervention influenced performance. After this final task, all children were debriefed and told the second set of problems was much harder than the first, and was in fact designed for seventh-graders. The researchers ensured that all children felt proud of their performance before leaving the experiment. The results of this study are extremely interesting in terms of their implications for how rapidly children respond to feedback endorsing an entity or an incremental view. Regarding achievement motivation, 92% of the children who had received effort praise chose the learning goal after the first set of problems, by asking to receive additional problems that they would learn from. By comparison, just 8% of the children who had received the intelligence praise chose this option. The other 92% of the children who had received intelligence praise opted for problems that would be easy so they could look smart or do well. Among the children who had gotten no feedback, about half chose performance and half chose learning goals, in keeping with the baseline representation of entity and mastery theorists in the general U.S. population.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1931,"Children’s post-failure attributions after the second set of problems were also affected by the intervention. Those who had been praised for effort after the first problem set attributed their subsequent failure to diminished effort, whereas those who were praised for ability attributed their subsequent failure to lack of ability. Task enjoyment was also very much affected, with children who were praised for intelligence reporting less enjoyment of the task than children who were praised for effort. In terms of persistence, children praised for effort were more likely to want to take some additional problems home. Finally, performance on the third set of problems was also influenced by the intervention feedback after the first set. Children praised for effort did better on the third set of problems than they had on the first set, and children praised for intelligence performed worse. Children who had received no praise showed no change. Thus a single sentence of feedback attributing success to intelligence or effort was associated with a cascade of remarkably different reactions to a subsequent failure event. In five subsequent experiments, the researchers replicated and extended these basic findings. When people with an entity view of intelligence (enduring or induced by feedback) face failure, they attribute the failure to a fixed quality of the self. In the context of such an attribution, people avoid further challenge, instead seeking evidence that they are indeed smart. If brief experimenter feedback can have such a large impact on children, parent and teacher feedback, which continues over time and comes from people who are very important to a child, would be expected to have even more. As was discussed in chapter 5, even when teachers simply told children a test would show “how good you are in relation to other children your age,” children’s performance declined (Graham & Golan, 1991).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1932,"The studies just described show that a feedback event (or a short series of such events) can influence immediate reactions even in very young children. But mastery-oriented and helpless styles are not only temporary states of reaction to recent feedback. In the absence of particular feedback manipulations, children’s responses to challenging situations has been shown to remain stable from kindergarten until fifth grade (Ziegert, Kistner, Castro, & Robertson, 2001), and there is no reason to believe they change thereafter. The research suggests that how adults talk to children about their accomplishments has a host of important consequences. Dweck (1999) describes many other interesting outcomes and considerations regarding these two theories of self as malleable or fixed. The fact that adult feedback appears to push children toward adopting one or the other such view is what is important to the ideas of this chapter. Adult feedback that endorses a malleable view of intelligence is clearly better for children.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1933,"Consistent with Dweck’s findings, Dr. Montessori was against using any sort of entity evaluation of a child, positive or negative. “To tell a person he is clever or clumsy, bright or stupid, good or bad, is a form of betrayal. The child must see for himself what he can do, and it is important to give him not only the means of education but also to supply him with indicators which tell him his mistakes. . . .

Teachers were advised to have this sense about themselves, and to pass this sense on to children.

excerpt_1935,"Not correcting children’s work was part of this incremental approach. Dr. Montessori held that children naturally correct their mistakes when they can perceive those mistakes, just as a baby corrects his or her own mistakes in learning to walk. A child learns through repetition of exercises where the mistakes are obvious, she claimed, not from an adult’s correcting his or her work. “What is meant by correcting exercise books? It means marking them from 0 to 10. How can a zero correct anyone’s defects?” (1967a, p. 245). Instead, Dr. Montessori counseled that correction comes from the child’s own observation of his mistakes in the outcome, and that the materials the child works with should make it obvious to the child when he has erred (see the discussion in chapter 5 on the Control of Error).",Montessori,Academic/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Dr. Montessori clearly valued intrinsic over performance reasons for one’s work: “If work comes from an inner source, it is much more intense and much more fruitful” (1989, p. 85). Whether Montessori children do have more of a mastery orientation toward schoolwork than do children in traditional school situations is a question for empirical study. Children in other nontraditional school systems clearly do (for example, Boaler, 1997; Boaler & Staples, 2003).

Children can stop and daydream for a time, pick up a recreational book, engage in free drawing, perhaps go outside and play, and so on. Of course, children are not free to abandon their education, and the teacher is responsible for noticing if a child is not using time wisely and intervening if needed.

excerpt_1941,"To the extent that children might interact with other children in traditional schooling arrangements, those others are usually of about the same age and ability. One might say that children are grouped in narrow bands. The first band is by age level: most of the children in the classroom are born within one year of each other, with a set birth date as the cut-off for being part of a classroom. Within each classroom, in many schools children are also grouped by ability level for each subject (“tracked”). By learning in this manner, children are removed from other children who are at very different levels. Their learning occurs in a narrow ability band. This is convenient to a factory model, since factories operate most efficiently if all of the raw materials are uniform. It suits the Lockean model of the child as well, since children at the same level are assumed to be alike and thus ready for the same knowledge to be poured in.",Traditional,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1942,"To examine this, researchers exposed toddlers to either a female adult or a 3-year-boy performing a variety of actions (Ryalls, Gul, & Ryalls, 2000). While sitting on their mothers’ laps, the children observed the model performing action sequences such as inserting a ball into a plastic egg, closing the egg, and shaking it. To see if they imitated the model’s actions, children were given the objects immediately and again after a one-week delay. Regardless of the delay time, children who had seen a slightly older peer model replicated a greater number of complex action sequences than did children exposed to an adult model, suggesting the peer elicited more imitation. This is a fascinating finding in need of replication. Because only one model was used for each condition, it is possible that some other difference in the models besides their peer/adult status was responsible for the result. We know, for example, that people are particularly apt to imitate those with whom they have better rapport (Bernieri, 1988), and perhaps children felt more rapport with the child for reasons other than age. More research is needed on this issue, using several different peer and adult models, but the finding is intriguing.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

The older children are interested in the younger, and the younger in the older” (Montessori, 1989, pp. 68–69). A child enters the Primary classroom at 21 ⁄2 or 3 years of age and remains there until he or she has completed the “cycle of materials,” the full set of materials Dr. Montessori determined was optimal for a Primary classroom.

The psychologist Mary Ainsworth (1967), Bowlby’s colleague, moved the attachment construct from the theoretical to the empirical realm by establishing a method to assess attachment.

Over the next 15 or 20 minutes, the mother and a stranger come and go in a series of prearranged episodes. At one point the child is alone with the toys, then the door opens and in walks not the mother but the stranger. This is often very upsetting to the child, who usually already appeared stressed over being left alone.

For this measure, the child’s teacher or some other trained observer sorts preselected statements concerning a child’s possible profile into piles indicating whether the statements are more or less characteristic of the child. The statements are about such issues as how the child responds to fearful situations, the child’s predominant mood, and how often the child seeks proximity and comfort.

In one study, people who were tested in the Strange Situation as infants and as adults found that 72% of participants were classified with the convergent attachment styles at both time points (Waters, Merrick, Treboux, Crowell, & Albersheim, 2000).

excerpt_1960,"Given the importance of the construct to predicting later competence and well-being, a pertinent question is what leads a child to have a particular type of relationship with the caregiver. Bowlby (1969) and Ainsworth (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) believed that an important antecedent factor in attachment style was adult sensitivity, and research has borne out that possibility (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Discussion following refers to maternal sensitivity because that was Ainsworth’s main concern, but the constructs seem to apply to any close caregiver. Important attachment relationships also of course develop with fathers (Grossmann et al., 2002), and they also appear to develop with day-care providers and teachers. Children growing up on Israeli kibbutzim become attached to their caregivers, and the quality of those relationships also predicts children’s outcomes (Oppenheim, Sagi, & Lamb, 1988). Children with a secure attachment to their kibbutz caregiver were later more goal directed and achievement oriented than were other children. This is consistent with work showing that American children’s relationships with their kindergarten teachers are related to their academic and behavioral outcomes through eighth grade (Hamre & Pianta, 2001).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1961,"Awareness requires that the mother be proximate to the infant so that she can perceive the infant’s signals. This aspect of attachment theory led to a concern beginning in the 1970s about whether babies placed in day care could become attached to their mothers. After many years of controversy, the recent National Study of Day Care, involving a representative sample of over 1,000 American children in a variety of day-care arrangements, has shown that use of day care has no significant impact on child-mother attachment relations (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). It is the mother’s awareness of signals when she is with the infant that appears to matter, and not that she is with the infant at all times. One might revise Ainsworth’s criteria for awareness, then, to read that the adult must be proximate to the infant for some reasonable amount of time, and when proximate, must be able to perceive the infant’s signals. A second aspect of awareness, besides proximity, is having a low perceiving threshold.

Adults must interpret the babies’ signals for what they are, rather than distorting the signals in some way. Distortions could be caused by adults projecting their own needs on the infant, denying the infant’s needs because of their own needs, or any other biasing of the infant’s signals to accord with the adult’s own wishes and needs. Ainsworth noted that to overcome such proclivities, the adult must have self-insight. A second feature necessary to accurate interpretation, according to Ainsworth, is empathy. Adults who lack empathy, she said, would have detached, intellectual relations with babies instead of warm, sensitive ones. “A mother might be quite aware of and understand accurately the baby’s behavior and the circumstances leading to her baby’s distress or demands, but because she is unable to empathize with him -- unable to see things from the baby’s point to view--she may tease him back into good humor, mock him, laugh at him, or just ignore him” (Ainsworth, 1969, p. 2). Lack of empathy thus leads to inappropriate response.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1963,"Even correctly interpreted signals can be followed by inappropriate responses. The third main feature of sensitivity for Ainsworth is that the response to the perceived and accurately interpreted signal be an appropriate one. Ainsworth noted that in the first year, the appropriate response to the baby is almost always what the child “asks” for via his or her signals: pick the child up when the signal indicates a desire to be held, feed the child when the signal indicates hunger, and so on. After the first year, Ainsworth noted that doing exactly as the baby asks is no longer always the best response. As they get older, children increasingly need to adapt to the world, rather than always expecting the world to adapt to them. On the other hand, children also need to feel some sense of control or efficacy, as suggested by the research presented in chapter 3. Ainsworth advised that thebest response after age 1 is a compromise response that keeps the child’s long-range interests at heart.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1964,The final feature of sensitivity concerns timing of the response. Ainsworth noted that responses must be prompt to be effective. Adults who were devoted to a rigid feed or sleep schedule would be insensitive on this point. Responses need to be timed closely after the baby’s calls for attention for the baby to experience the efficacy of his or her actions.,Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1965,"Ainsworth’s theoretical ideas regarding sensitivity were compiled into a rating scale on which the sensitivity of primary caregivers to their children could be scored by trained observers watching mothers and children interact. Ainsworth’s original study of 23 mother-child pairs found a remarkably strong relationship between maternal sensitivity and child attachment classification (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Many studies have been done in the meantime, and the results are not as strong; some even fail to show a relationship. When results are inconsistent, the best response is a meta-analysis combining results across many studies. A recent meta-analysis of maternal sensitivity and attachment shows there is a relationship between the two factors, such that (in statistical terms) a child’s chances of being securely attached move from 38% if a mother is not sensitive to 62% if the mother is sensitive (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Because all scales and measures are prone to some degree of “measurement error,” the relationship in real terms might be stronger.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1966,"The issue of direction of effects naturally arises here. Perhaps the reason some mothers respond sensitively has to do with characteristics of the infant, and those infant characteristics lead to the later positive outcomes. In this view, the mother has no direct bearing on the child’s later outcomes. The obvious infant characteristic to consider is the child’s personality (or temperament), and studies have been done examining the relationship between child personality and attachment security (Vaughn & Bost, 1999). The upshot of these studies is that although personality predicts some aspects of behavior in the Strange Situation, it does not predict reunion behaviors, which are the most diagnostic of relationship quality.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1967,"One could still argue, however, that some aspect of the child is responsible for attachment classification. Experimental designs can address this. In fact, several intervention studies have been conducted, in which mothers were trained to respond more sensitively to their infants and changes in attachment classification following the intervention were examined. A recent meta-analysis of 88 intervention studies showed that short, focused interventions related to maternal sensitivity were effective both in making parents respond more sensitively to their infants and in changing infant attachment status (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van Ijzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). Such work strongly suggests that maternal sensitivity has a causal relationship to attachment classification.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1968,"Ainsworth’s rating scales were designed for observation of mothers with their infants. But a mother’s interaction style with a child evolves over time. Other research has looked at how parents of securely attached infants behave toward them somewhat later, as toddlers and preschoolers. One can view this as addressing how the sensitive pattern of responding adapts as children age. Mothers whose children were insecurely attached as infants tend to interact more intrusively with them in first and second grades (Egeland, Pianta, & O’Brien, 1993). Their interaction styles are more directive, such that they are more apt to tell their children exactly what to do. In contrast, parents of securely attached children tend not simply to tell the children what to do, but instead make suggestions, helping children to figure things out for themselves (Fagot, Gauvain, & Kavanagh, 1996; Frankel & Bates, 1990; Matas et al., 1978; Moss, 1992). They are closely involved, but nonintrusive. In Bruner’s (1975) terms, echoing Vygotsky, parents of securely attached children provide ideal scaffolds for children, structuring the environment such that children can internalize problem-solving strategies (see also Gauvain, 2001), whereas parents of insecurely attached children are more directive. Secure attachment styles in infancy are associated with parenting styles that evolve in positive ways as children get older.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1969,"Dr. Montessori advised that teachers show a degree of warmth and sensitivity that is reminiscent of the characteristics of parents whose children are securely attached. The focal period for forming attachment relationships (12 to 18 months) is of course usually prior to the age of entry into a Montessori classroom. Yet there is nothing to indicate that the adult behaviors associated with particular attachment styles cease to matter, and indeed those behaviors are consistent with literature suggesting optimal parenting practices for older children as well. As children get older, they still appear to need a safe haven and a secure base; they simply need it less often and feel comfortable venturing farther away.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1970,"Dr. Montessori saw the task of childhood as being to become increasingly independent, and the role of the adult as assisting children toward that independence. As is indicated in the quote above, Dr. Montessori maintained the teacher should serve as a safe haven whenever the child needs that. Yet when the child is ready to explore, the Montessori teacher was advised to be sensitive to the child’s need for increased independence, heeding the child’s call to “Help me to do it alone!” (Montessori, 1948/1976, p. 103).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1971,"To determine when a child needs a secure base, the Montessori teacher was advised to be very attentive to the children, with the observational acuity of a well-trained scientist. Indeed, Dr. Montessori (1917/1965) said, “The fundamental quality [teachers must possess was] a capacity for observation” (p. 130). Like the sensitive parents described by Ainsworth (1969), teachers’ thresholds for perceiving signals should be low. They should be trained to notice and correctly interpret the behavioral manifestations of the child’s inner state, in order to know what to do next. As is discussed later in the chapter with regard to teacher training, Dr. Montessori also advised teachers to develop self-understanding, so they do not misinterpret children’s signals in ways that align with their own needs.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1972,"When children are concentrating on work, Dr. Montessori held that they should be left alone, because during such moments, she believed, they are developing themselves. In chapter 3, I discussed the idea that concentration might be an engine of self-regulation, which is associated with many positive personality variables. Dr. Montessori saw concentration as the moment of self-development. Because of this theoretical stance, she held that teachers must watch for any concentrated purposeful movement, so as to let it go undisturbed; the child must be protected from stimuli that would break the concentration. For example, Dr. Montessori described an incident in which a child who had thus far been disorderly in school one day began to rearrange the furniture, with an expression of intense interest. The teacher was inclined to stop him, but Dr. Montessori saw his activity as coordinated toward a useful end, and manifesting that child’s first moments of concentration on purposeful activity in the classroom. According to Dr. Montessori, a sensitive teacher would leave a child alone in such actions, as long as the child was not disturbing others.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_1973,"The Montessori teacher must also be sensitive to when the child is ready for something new, because “the brain always asks for work which becomes more complex” (Montessori, 1989, p. 89). After great concentration a child may need to rest or simply observe others (Montessori, 1989, p. 19), but at a certain point the child will be ready for more complex work. The teacher must be attuned to such moments, and give the child new work when the child is ready. Further, like parents of securely attached children in problem-solving situations, the Montessori teacher must structure the environment in such a way that children can make discoveries on their own. Telling children, as traditional teaching often involves, is associated with insecure attachment relationships.",Montessori,Cognitive/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Behaviorist approaches, notably that of Thorndike, specified that the teacher’s role was to establish useful bonds in the child’s mind and eliminate useless and negative ones. Being businesslike was important in this approach as well; such concepts as “emotional warmth” do not figure prominently in behaviorist discourse; in the rare instances when Thorndike mentions emotional qualities for a teacher, it tends to be in a footnote (e.g., Thorndike, 1906/1962, p. 63). Thorndike’s recommendation for how a teacher should give instructions, for example, was to say, “Do the work on this page. Do it again, keeping track of how many minutes you spend. Practice again until you can get all the answers right in 12 minutes” (Thorndike, 1921b, p. 17). Communication was to be simple, direct, and dry.

Children apparently surprised her repeatedly by showing interest in real activities over play, and she responded by creating an educational system that expects maturity, as do authoritative parents. This can put people off, because they see Montessori education as not being sufficiently fun. Empirical research should more directly address this issue, but the Middle School study mentioned previously (Rathunde & Csikszentmihalyi, in press) and other work concerning children’s motivation and affect when engaged in Montessori-like practices (collaborative learning, lack of extrinsic rewards, and so) in traditional settings suggest that it is probably not a concern.

excerpt_2000,"As was discussed earlier, Dr. Montessori advised that adults show great emotional warmth when dealing with children. Children must have “a teacher who looks on them with love and hope” (Montessori, 1989, p. 79). Yet at the same time, the adult’s ultimate control of the environment was clearly a high priority. The pitfalls of permissive adult attitudes were pointed out in her writing. “If freedom is understood as letting the children do as they like, using or more likely misusing, the things available, it is clear that only their ‘deviations’ are free to develop” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 206). Permissive parents are often thought of as ones who want to be their children’s friends; it is hard for them to exercise authority. Dr. Montessori saw the dangers in this: “The teacher must be superior and not just a friend. . . . [Children] need a dignified, mature person. . . . If they have no authority, they have no directive. Children need this support” (1989, p. 17). Some Montessori teachers, like some parents, err in this regard. They do not provide ultimate control over the environment, deal effectively with unproductive behaviors, or guide children’s decisions in positive ways. Freedom can thus be taken to an extreme, and Dr. Montessori counseled against this repeatedly. “One time I saw an entire class of disorganized children who were using the materials completely wrongly. The teacher drifted about in the class, silent as the Sphinx. . . . This teacher was committing a grave error: She feared disturbing their disorder, instead of attempting to establish the order” (Montessori, 1956, p. 140).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Dr. Montessori also spoke against an authoritarian stance: “The teacher can address the pupil energetically and severely and thus jolt him out of his behavior, but those who know their jobs well have means more effective than coercion for recalling the pupil to order” (1956, p. 141). Authoritarian parents tell children to do things because the parent says so; they do not reason with the child, and they appear to take on a stance that they are infallible. Yet adults who work with children have to admit to being fallible (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246). Education, she said, was traditionally “directed toward the suppression or bending of the child’s will, and the substitution for it of the teacher’s will, which demands from the child unquestioning obedience” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 252).

Both as children get older, and when standardized testing is emphasized, teachers in traditional schools become more prone to create classroom environments that are at odds with more optimal child outcomes. In the context of traditional education, teachers can attempt to overcome the negative effects of grades and testing, and the inherently competitive, comparative system they create. The system, however, was designed for their use, and as the current enthusiasm for high-stakes testing shows, as a culture we keep returning to it.

The Montessori teacher’s goal is clearly the child’s self-regulation; the teacher’s task was well done when the teacher was needed only to give additional lessons. “Any pedagogical action, if it is to be efficacious in the training of little children, must tend to help the children to advance upon this road of independence” (Montessori, 1912/1964, p. 97).

There is no need to fear that she will interrupt some important psychic process, since these have not yet begun. Before concentration occurs, the directress may do more or less what she thinks best; she may interfere with the children’s activities as much as she thinks necessary” (1967a, p. 278).

excerpt_2012,"If concentration leads to better self-regulation, as research presented in chapter 3 suggests it does, then teachers are probably most apt to see misbehavior in newly established Montessori classrooms, before children have begun to concentrate (although of course misbehavior might surface anytime!). Dr. Montessori was quite clear that any disruptive or socially unacceptable behavior should always be checked. She recommended doing so by redirection rather than punishment. “Interfere by all means to stop disturbances, but we need not punish or scold or admonish when we stop bad behavior; we can ask the child to come and pick flowers in the garden or offer a toy or any occupation that will appeal to [the child]” (Montessori, 1989, p. 16).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2013,"She also recommended that misbehaving children be shown positive attention, such as being taken aside and shown something new as though they are very special. Thus at this stage, and indeed whenever a child is not productively engaged, misbehaving children should be interrupted and redirected. In this manner Dr. Montessori seemed to be endorsing authoritative parenting: high warmth and high control. She believed there was no such thing as a bad child, only children with unfulfilled needs (Montessori, 1989, p. 78).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2014,"Eventually, as a new classroom settles, children will one by one begin to concentrate. She suggested that once children have begun to concentrate, the adult step back. She often described the adult’s role at this point, once children have begun to concentrate, as passive, but she clearly meant a very attentive sort of passivity. “Passive” apparently only referred to the idea that the adult not interfere with the child’s concentration. She stated that adults often err by praising children who are concentrating, or by correcting their errors. Both, she said, lead children to abandon their work in moments of concentration. Praise and correction at the wrong time disrupt the very process that one was aiming for.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

She mentions that children, particularly early on, will bring the products of their work to adults and ask for praise, and at such times, she advised adults to give praise warmly and generously. The claim that calling a child “good” is a form of betrayal suggests she would not condone person praise, but leaves open whether she would condone product or process praise or both. When a child comes to an adult seeking praise, she said, then the child needs praise as assurance that he or she is on the right track (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 88).

This training includes both personal preparation as well as education in the lessons and materials.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2019,"An ability to observe children and detect their needs is fundamental to good Montessori teaching. Dr. Montessori maintained that the capacity to observe children has to be carefully developed through long practice (1917/1965, p. 130). In the AMI Montessori teacher training courses, scores of hours are spent with children, observing their actions, recording those observations, and crafting them into reports to be reviewed by the teacher trainer. Dr. Montessori advocated training in science, rather than in education, for people who would go into Montessori teaching, in part because training in science is training in close observation (Montessori, 1917/1965, p. 138). She was also concerned that training in traditional education might make it more difficult to become a good Montessori teacher. “An ordinary teacher cannot be transformed into a Montessori teacher, but must be created anew, having rid herself of pedagogical prejudices” (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 87).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2020,"Teachers had to rid themselves of pride and anger, to become humble and charitable, and to “check those inner attitudes characteristic of adults that can hinder our understanding of a child” (Montessori, 1966, p. 153). This is reminiscent of Ainsworth’s discussion of sensitivity, in which the sensitive mother is free from distortions caused by her own needs and desires, a state that aids her in seeing the child’s signals for what they are. This emphasis on one’s personal preparation to be a teacher contrasts sharply with traditional teacher training, which focuses more on how one does things than on one’s own psychology. In fact, the Montessori approach is more in keeping with training psychoanalysts, since they must go through analysis themselves first.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2021,"To teach about the material and its presentation, AMI teacher training generally requires nine months of lecture with internships in a variety of Montessori classrooms and observation time intermingled. The teacher trainer oversees the trainee’s learning of lessons and supervises the internships and observations. Lectures and practicums enable trainees to learn about the materials and the variety of ways in which they can be used to stimulate interest and use, as well as the interconnections between materials across the curriculum. Trainees learn to present the materials, with all the variations, to children (by practicing on the trainer and fellow trainees prior to internships).",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2022,"For this reason as well, as was described earlier, AMI training also involves making several “albums,” normally three-ring binders of typed and illustrated pages describing everything one has been presented during the course. Effectively, the Montessori teacher-in-training writes his or her own textbook concerning Montessori materials and theory. The knowledge in these albums is of course not as deep and thorough as that of the teacher trainer, just as the notes of a student taking a college course would not reflect all the knowledge of the professor, but they are sufficiently thorough to allow the teacher to refer to them over the coming years, and to guide his or her lessons in the future. Some other Montessori teacher training courses routinely give teachers copies of the information rather than having them write and illustrate it themselves. This is not a good change: research has shown that taking one’s own notes leads to better learning than does reading prewritten ones (Annis, 1981; Kulhavy, Dyer, & Silver, 1975).",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

In learning the parts of plants, for example, Primary children examine a plant and make free drawings of the whole plant, and then, on separate pages, draw each of its parts. The separate parts are colored in to set them off, the name of the highlighted part is written on each page, and the pages are put together into a booklet. Primary children thus learn the words ""stamen,"" ""pistil,"" and so on, in the context of a real plant and their own drawings of it. ... Montessori applies the same approach to teaching spelling. Rather than having a published spelling workbook, from which every child in the class learns the same words (the factory), Montessori children learn words they personally need to know, because they misspelled them in a report or other writing. Indeed, all the information children learn as part of writing reports, not just the spelling and vocabulary, but all the facts and relationships, are learned at the point of need.

excerpt_2183,"""undergraduates were asked to memorize a list of words in a hierarchical tree structure"" (Bower, Clark, Lesgold, & Winzenz, 1969) If the unschooled children were given a structural organization that made sense to them, their memory capacities might prove equivalent to those of schooled children. The structural organization involved was a diorama of a miniature town, into which 20 small items, including animals, cars, people, and so on, were logically placed while the children, Maya and American 8- and 9-year-olds, looked on. The 20 objects were then replaced into the pool of 80 items from which they were drawn, and the children were asked to reconstruct the scene. Although the Maya sample had shown much poorer memory previously on a standard list task, their performance was even slightly better than that of the American children in this organized task. Although children learn to memorize lists of unrelated items in Traditional schools, one might question whether this is a good use of their processing resources.Transitive inference tasks are ones in which one learns that A > B and B > C, and one must infer that A > C. When the stimuli from which children made inferences were arranged in a physical order that mirrored their conceptual relations, children made correct inferences significantly more often than when the stimuli were arranged randomly. All of these studies suggest that organization at the task level assists cognitive processes.",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Order in Environment and Mind,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2184,"She also made interesting observations about how children play hiding games that pertain to order. Dr. Montessori recounted that Piaget once played a hiding game with one of his children, hiding an object under a pillow, having his child leave the room, moving the object to another pillow, and then asking the child to find it. When the child did not see the object under the first pillow, the child gave up. Piaget then showed the child how he had moved the object, and repeated the procedure. The child behaved in exactly the same way, whereupon Piaget lifted the second pillow and asked, ""Didn’t you see I put it here?"" (on the prior hiding trial). ""Yes,"" his child replied, ""but it should be there"" (pointing to the first pillow) (Montessori, 1966, pp. 53–54). Although to Piaget this task was probably about inference, to Dr. Montessori the incident was about the child’s need to find the object in its proper place. She also noted that children often play hide-and-seek by hiding in the same place over and over, or in the place where the last hider was just found. She saw this as also reflecting a need for order, for there being set places and times for objects and events.

excerpt_2185,"In traditional schooling, the preschool years are considered an important time for social learning, and children are often free to play together. When children hit elementary school, social time is over: children usually are moved to separate desks and must generally work and be tested alone. Yet this is opposite to what we know about children: preschoolers often prefer parallel play, since their social skills are often not well honed. In elementary school, children become intensely social, and really want to interact with each other",Traditional,Social,Example,excerpt,Education for Children,excerpt_dataset,

Vygotsky argued that learning occurs in a zone of proximal development, meaning over tasks one cannot yet accomplish alone but can accomplish in the company of a more advanced other. In his view, slightly advanced peers serve as important leaders of development (Hogan & Tudge, 1999; Vygotsky, 1978).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2193,". In the early 1960s, the psychologist Albert Bandura provided the classic evidence that learning can occur through observation and imitation (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963). Bandura showed children films of an adult hitting a wobbly blow-up “Bobo” doll and noted that children were later apt to behave toward the doll as the adult had. According to behaviorists, such learning should not have occurred, because children were not rewarded directly for the behaviors they later enacted. The studies made the point that learning can occur by simply watching what others do, irrespective of personal rewards. Along with other important developments at the time, Bandura’s work helped to turn the dominant paradigm of American psychology from behaviorism to cognitive science",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2194,"Dr. Montessori described an early case in which it became apparent to her that children’s tendency to imitate others can be a useful source of inlearning from peers 197 spiration in school, advancing children to new abilities. This observation, called the “explosion” into writing, recurs annually in well-functioning Montessori Primary classrooms when the first 4-year-old suddenly realizes, after months of working with the preparatory materials, that he or she can write. “The first word to be written by one of them brought a great outburst of joy and laughter. Everyone looked admiringly at ‘the writer,’ and thus they felt moved to follow his example. ‘I can do it too!’ they cried. The achievement of one started off the whole group” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 231). Other 4-year-olds, having also been indirectly prepared to write through the use of knobs on Wooden Cylinders and other materials, pencils in Metal Insets, and so on, as was described in chapter 1, spontaneously began writing in reaction to having observed a first child reaching that landmark. Obviously children also see others learn to write in traditional schools; what is unique in Montessori is the series of steps, all visible and imitable, that lead children along the path to writing, so that a community of 4-year-olds can discover they already have the ability to write once they see it done by another child.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2195,"Children also can learn about social behavior in Montessori classrooms by observing how others behave in natural, nonscripted situations. Whereas in traditional classrooms, children learn how to sit still and listen to the teacher, in Montessori, they can learn how to interact with each other. The oldest children in the classroom can serve as examples to the younger ones. “The undisciplined child enters into discipline by working in the company of others, not by being told that he is naughty” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246).",Montessori,Social,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2196,". Dr. Montessori also noted that by observing older children, younger ones can see what they will later be able to do themselves, and that this is motivating. “To understand what the older ones are doing fills the little ones with enthusiasm” (1967a, p. 228).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2197,"One might wonder how learning by observation in a Montessori classroom is possible for the oldest children, who are working at the highest levels with many of the available materials. Facilitating their learning by observation, Dr. Montessori urged that children be allowed to visit other classrooms. “The classroom for those of three to six is not even rigidly separated from that of the children from seven to nine. Thus, children of six can get ideas from the class above. . . . One can always go for an intellectual walk!” (1967a, p 227).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2198,"In contrast, in traditional schools, people’s sense is usually that smaller classes are better for children.

excerpt_2199,"Anecdotally, Montessorians report that when more than one adult is active in a classroom, children are less apt to work independently and with each other, but turn instead to an adult. Other arguments for a single teacher, such as integration of knowledge, were discussed in chapter 4.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2200,"One study of the efficacy of such a system (“Classwide Peer Tutoring”) involved first- and second-grade classrooms in low-income schools (Greenwood et al., 1987). Classrooms were randomly assigned to tutoring and control conditions for spelling. In control classrooms, teachers used standard methods of teaching spelling: a workbook with word lists and vocabulary exercises, chalkboard, self-study, and homework assignments. In classrooms that used the tutoring program, the tutoring process described earlier replaced some in-class spelling work. Over the two years of the study, children in the peer tutoring classrooms were spelling 87% of the words correctly on average, whereas children in other classrooms were spelling 75% of words correctly. This is not an enormous difference, but it is certainly a meaningful one. Peering tutoring programs also appear to confer many social benefits on the classroom (Fantuzzo, Riggio, Connelly, & Dimeff, 1989; Maheady & Sainato, 1985). In addition, they apparently benefit learning other topics and over the long term",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2201,"In one demonstration of these benefits, a follow-up study expanded the peer tutoring to cover reading, math, and language, and examined children’s performance over multiple years. Children in the tutoring program performed significantly better than those in the control group on all three topics both immediately and two years later, when they had moved on to middle school and no longer had the program. They also performed better in two nontutored topics: science and social studies. They even performed as well as children in a higher SES group in all these areas (Greenwood et al., 1989). In addition, fewer children from the peer tutoring group were placed in special-education classes (Greenwood, Terry, Utley, Montagna, & Walker, 1993). This study is among many suggesting that peer tutoring programs, appropriately structured, improve learning in traditional schools and that the benefits extend across time and topics (see Topping & Ehly, 1998).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2202,"Peer tutoring programs vary in terms of how structured each tutoring session is, and more structured programs are typically associated with greater success. Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) is an example of a more structured tutoring program (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998), and it has also been used to examine the effect of rewards. RPT begins with training sessions about teamwork and cooperation, and children are told they can win rewards by using teamwork. In the RPT program, teaching aides show the children how to tutor each other. Then RPT sessions are held twice weekly for 45 minutes each. Special flash-card materials are used, with a problem on one side and steps to the solution on the other. Children decide who will be tutor first in each session, and work for 10 minutes on problems before switching roles. After the initial 20 minutes, problem drill sheets are administered, and students attempt the problems, then switch papers with partners for correction. Performance on the drill sheets accrues points, which lead to such rewards as being teacher’s helper or working on a special project. When children were randomly assigned to RPT versus traditional instruction groups, those in the RPT groups consistently showed higher levels of mathematics achievement (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998). Two alternative groups were also formed, one with the reward but lacking the structure provided by the flash cards, and the other having the structure but no reward. The combination of rewards and structure led to the most gains in both achievement and positive social behavior. Structure alone, without rewards, was associated with better behavior both in the tutoring sessions and in the regular classroom situation. Students also perceived themselves to be more competent when using structured than when using unstructured tutoring, but achievement was not improved in the absence of rewards (Fantuzzo, King, & Heller, 1992). Thus, within a traditional school environment, more structured peer interactions with a reward structure optimized learning and behavior. The issue of rewards is important and is discussed further in the context of collaborative learning.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2203,"Although supplementing whole-class teaching with peer tutoring improves achievement, adults are even more effective tutors than peers. The research suggests several reasons for this that shed light on how peer tutoring can be most effective. First, adults structure the task in ways that keep the overarching goal in clear focus, whereas child partners tend to focus on parts of the problem, losing sight of the whole--a difference reminiscent of the differences between same-age experts and novices. For example, if the task is planning a route for doing a set of errands as efficiently as possible, child pairs will get the errands done, but not as efficiently, because they focus on each individual item to be retrieved separately, rather than thinking about how several items can be grouped to make for more efficient routes. Adult tutors get children to think about grouping items. However, when the peer tutor is trained in this task and taught to consider how to group items, tutee performance does improve. Nonetheless, performance even with a trained peer tutor does not improve to the level obtained when the tutor was an adult (Gauvain, 2001).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2204,"A second probable reason for the greater success of adult tutors is that adults tend to include children more in the task at hand. Other children can become autocratic, as children are inclined to focus on who gets to do what. Children tend to like to do; adults more easily sit back, watch, and guide. Research has shown that peer learning is also more successful when peers listen to each other and question each other more (reviewed below), skills that many adults have but many children have not yet learned (Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2205,"Perhaps in part because peer tutors can become autocratic, some research suggests that, when tutored by a peer, the tutee benefits maximally from a peer who is just a bit more advanced rather than much more advanced. For example, research on both scientific and moral reasoning has shown that children benefit from exposure to thought processes that are just above their current level (Damon & Killen, 1982; Kuhn, 1972; Turiel & Rothman, 1972)",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2206,"Besides being less able to adapt to a lower level of tutee, much older and more advanced peer tutors sometimes practice social dominance. The problems of autocracy mentioned earlier thus become exacerbated, and the tutee learns less, because he or she is less involved in the decision-making process. This was found in a study in which 5-year-old novices were paired either with 5- or 7-year-olds who were considered experts at planning routes (as in the study just described) (Duran & Gauvain, 1993). Children were more involved with the task when paired with an advanced planner of their own age, as opposed to an older planner, and this increased involvement predicted better performance. Whether the particular age gap used in this experiment (5 to 7) is a particularly problematic one would be an interesting topic for research. The age of 6 is a pivotal one, recognized in many of the world’s cultures as an appropriate time to ask more of children, such as by beginning formal schooling (Rogoff, 1981). Six is the age at which Piaget speculated children advance to being able to perform mental operations (for example, imagining addition and subtraction), and which Dr. Montessori considered transitional between her first and second planes of development. At each plane, she said, children think differently. Examining whether 6- and 8-, or 7- and 9-year-olds, make more effective tutoring pairs would be of interest. The research suggests that peers who are slightly advanced, but not too advanced, make more optimal tutors, but it might also be the case that tutors who are within particular age spans are best",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

After hearing the first story, children who did not solve it spontaneously (about 80% of them) were shown the solution. The second story was about a man who needed to get hay bales on a high tractor--a problem that could also be solved by stacking items. Some children were simply told the story, whereas others were asked to teach the solution to a Kermit the Frog puppet.

He reasoned that close student contact, for the purpose of helping others, might alleviate problems, and so created learning arrangements that would lead to such contact. In the Jigsaw model, children are placed in groups of five or six and topics of study are broken into as many segments. For the topic of the Civil War, for example, one person might be assigned to study the history of slavery, another the type of weapons used in the era, another the major battles, 210 Montessori and so on. Children research their topic on their own, and then temporarily join a new group composed of the child from every other group in the class who was assigned their same topic. These “homogenous” groups share information and practice presentations of their topics. Finally, children reunite with their original groups, and each child teaches the material. A test on all the material generally follows. The Jigsaw method has repeatedly been found to improve learning as well as classroom social relations (Aronson, 2002; Bridgeman, 1981; Lazarowitz, Hertz-Lazarowitz, & Baird, 1994). In terms of academic achievement, it is particularly successful with minority youths, but in some cases it has improved, and in no cases (to my knowledge) has it negatively affected, the learning of other students (Lucker, Rosenfield, Sikes, & Aronson, 1977; Slavin, 1983).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

Children who worked together and were encouraged to talk were most likely to solve the puzzles and produced the most interpretive talk. Even when children were alone and encouraged to talk to themselves, their use of interpretive talk was positively related to their ability to solve the puzzles. Descriptive talk, which is more characteristic of children in the kindergarten years, was associated with low levels of performance on the problem-solving tasks. The children who performed the worst were ones who worked alongside others but were discouraged from talking at all, which is the typical arrangement in traditional elementary schools. In contrast, children at these ages in Montessori schools tend to work together, and they frequently talk while they work.

One group of children was told to engage in one of the activities so that they could later engage in the second one. Other children were simply told to engage in one activity, and then the other one, without it seeming as though the second were contingent on the first. About three weeks later, observers 158 Montessori noted that during free time, children who had participated in the contingent activity condition showed decreased interest in whichever activity they had first, and increased interest in the second activity. The other children showed no such difference.

excerpt_2233,"One particularly interesting study involved fifth-graders from three elementary schools (Grolnick & Ryan, 1987). All children read a passage, then were asked how much they enjoyed the passage, how difficult it was, and how pressured they felt. Then they were told they would read a second passage, with directions that varied by condition. Some children were told, ""After you are finished, I’m going to test you on it. I want to see how much you can remember. You should work as hard as you can, because I’ll be grading you on the test to see if you’re learning well enough."" Another group of children was told, ""After you are finished, I’ll be asking you some questions similar to the ones I just asked about the other passage."" Recall that these questions were about their personal reactions to the passages. After answering the questions about interest, pressure, and difficulty for the second reading, the children were asked to recall as much of the second 160 Montessori passage as they could. To test for conceptual learning, they were also asked to write an essay on the main point of the passage. To test long-term retention, a week later, children were asked to once again recall the second passage by rote and to write an essay describing the passage’s main point. The results were highly suggestive of what expectations about getting a grade do for learning. Students who thought they would be graded rendered the passage by rote best at the first test, but had also forgotten the most a week later, making their long-term retention equal to that of the children who thought they would be questioned only about their personal reactions. At second testing, the ""personal-reaction"" children retained almost all of the rote information reported at the first session. But rote learning is usually not what we really value, after all. Conceptual learning--drawing the main point from what we read--is much more important, and the results here are compelling. The essays of the students who did not expect a test or a grade showed significantly greater conceptual learning than did the essays of the children who did expect one. The upshot is that students who expect to be tested initially learn the facts better, by rote, but as soon as the test is over, they forget much of what they learned.

How can the boy get exactly 3 quarts of water using only these containers and not guessing at the amount?"" (p. 287). Half were told that they would receive a nickel for each correct solution, and a $1 bonus if all 10 solutions were correct. Correct solutions to the first 9 problems all involved a particular pattern of use of three jugs, but a correct solution to the 10th one involved just two jugs, so the 10th problem was a set breaker: it required that the participant break a response set to consider a problem in a new way. What was of interest was not whether problems were solved correctly, since that was expected, but instead how long it took to solve them, particularly the set breaker. Whereas participants in both groups took equally long on the initial 9 items, the set-breaking 10th problem took participants in the nonreward condition only about half as long to solve as the participants who were trying for the $1 bonus.

To cement this promise, they signed an elaborate vow to later write the story. Other children also took two pictures before writing their story, but it was not construed as an advance reward. A second manipulation was that for half of the children in each group, the activities were labeled play, and for half they were labeled work. The researchers expected that the play label would be associated with higher creativity. The results indicated no significant effect of the work or play label on creativity, but a significant effect of how the picture taking was construed.

Some students were told that the researchers were interested in the quality of their collages, whereas others were told that the researchers were only interested in the mood that resulted from working on the collage. Of those who were told the quality of collage was important, some were told the specific criteria by which collage extrinsic rewards and motivation 163 quality would be judged.

Judges rated the quality of the drawings of the noncompetitive group more highly. Motivation and interest in the task were also affected, such that children in the competing group were less likely to want to engage in the activity again (see also White & Owen, 1970).

A second opportunity to sort papers arose later, while waiting for the experimenter to find a tape recorder. During this time, other activities such as reading comic books were also available. Children’s mothers also contributed to the data by describing how they used rewards for their children’s behaviors at home and how prosocial their children were. Children in the reward condition spent significantly less time sorting paper during the second, free-choice period than did children who did not receive a reward. Therefore motivation to subsequently engage in prosocial acts was negatively impacted by a prior expected reward. A particularly interesting finding is the relationship between mothers’ habitual use of rewards and children’s responses. Children whose mothers reported that they liked and used extrinsic rewards at home were most affected by the reward manipulation. They sorted significantly less paper, on average, and fewer than half of them sorted any paper at all at the second opportunity. Children whose mothers did not use rewards at home were much less impacted by rewards, and 85% of them helped by sorting paper.

excerpt_2247,"One interesting study examined the impact of grades on self theories, goals, and performance in sixth-graders using tasks with both fixed and open-ended solutions (Butler & Nisan, 1986). Some of the fixed-solution tests were word games, such as making as many words as possible from the letters of a long word and constructing new words using the first and last letters of a prior word. The open-ended tasks included a ""creative uses"" task in which one comes up with as many uses as possible for an object, and a ""circles"" task, in which one is given a page of nickel-sized circles to draw on, and the creativity of one’s drawings is rated. All children performed similarly on a pre-test composed of these tasks. Two days later, some of the children were surprised by the return of their test booklets with either verbal feedback specifying how they could have performed better (""You wrote many short words, but not many long ones"") or a score. All of the children then engaged in slightly different versions of the same tasks. A third session two hours later repeated the original tasks, and children answered questions regarding their motivation on the tasks and the sources of their performance. An important factor to remember for the results of these experiments is that they were conducted in the children’s school classroom, in a manner reminiscent of school assignments. By sixth grade, students have learned that what one does in school is important only when there is evaluative extrinsic rewards and motivation 167 feedback. Unfortunately, university students often appear to feel the same way, visibly going on vacation when told something will not be on the exam. In keeping with this, students who had not gotten their test booklets back before the second session (no feedback) did not perform as well as the others on the later tests. They probably did not see the assignment as important and did not put in effort. Consistent with other studies, the two different kinds of feedback led to differences in performance on the open-ended tasks (not on the fixedsolution ones). For example, students who received verbal feedback about how to do better thought of more uses for objects later than did students who had received grades. In addition, students who received comments reported higher levels of motivation on and more liking for the tasks than did those who received grades. What was new about this study was that grades and comments also had different impacts on what the students felt contributed to their performance: their theories of intelligence. Students who received comments attributed their performance to effort, interest, and skill, whereas students who received grades were more apt to attribute their performance to the reader’s mood: an external, uncontrollable variable. If one has an incremental theory, skill is something one can control. The reader’s mood, on the other hand, is outside one’s control. The literature on learned helplessness and issues discussed in chapter 3 arise. As was discussed there, entity theorists tend to feel helpless in the face of failure. Attributions of effort aligned with these different perceptions of what underlay their performance. Students in the grades group attributed their effort to a desire to avoid failure, whereas those who received comments attributed their effort to their interest in the task. The entity theorists’ performance goals are thus apparent in the group who received grades. Grades and other evaluations, then, undermine motivation perhaps in part because they tend to lead to performance goals instead of mastery ones. Grades appear to lead children to view their level of performance as reflecting their being smart or dumb, not as indicative of having studied hard or not.",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,

For the abstract group, all of the instruction examples were presented with general referents (""solid, liquid"") without any meaningful background theme. For example, one item read, ""There are three objects. Each is cut in one-half. In all, how many pieces would there be?"" (p. 73). The concrete group received hypothetical but concrete referents, for example stating that Bill had three candy bars, each of which he cut in half. The third group had examples that were intended to be most interesting, because they were personalized to concern matters of subjective importance, such as one’s birthday, teachers and friends, hobbies, and so on. For example, their teacher (mentioned by name) presented them with three Mars bars (their favorite candy) on their birthday, and if they cut each candy bar in half, how many friends could they share with? As bookends to these lessons, children took pre- and post-tests of their understanding of fractions. The results were clear in supporting that children learn best when the material is of personal interest. On the post-test, the abstract group scored lowest (averaging 2 of 11 problems correct), the concrete next-lowest (3.5 of 11), and the personalized group had the highest score (6 of 11).

Children in the control condition saw the game in an unembellished, rather banal format, with the title of ‘Math Game.’ For the other children, the game was presented within a spaceship fantasy context and either had the title ‘Space Quest’ and involved the child imagining she or he was piloting a spaceship to other planets to save Earth from an energy crisis, or else had the title ‘Treasure Hunt,’ and involved imagining he or she was the captain of a ship seeking buried treasure. Some children also had personalized games that began with the child’s name (‘Best of luck in your journey, Commander Christy’) and sent the child off on the journey with his or her own personal favorite foods. Children played these games three times at school over a two-week period, for 30 minutes each time. A week later they were tested on their knowledge of the use of parentheses in arithmetic expressions as well as their knowledge of arithmetic operations in a different context. Their enjoyment of the game, their own assessment of their performance, and their desired level of challenge in future games were also assessed. The results were quite clear. When interesting contexts had been provided, children showed better knowledge of how parentheses affect arithmetic operations and were better able to transfer that knowledge to non-computer contexts. Personalization augmented these effects. In addition, students’ motivation was clearly influenced by the manipulation. Students in the context conditions were much more likely to opt for the computer playing its best game, liked the game more, were more willing to stay after school to play the game, believed themselves to be better at the games, and indicated they would seek a more challenging game later.

At that point, all of the children were told, “Wow, you did very well on these problems.” No matter how they had actually done, all the children were told they had gotten 80% right. “That’s a really high score.” (Children were “debriefed” about the experiment later.) Then, roughly a third of the children were told, “You must be smart at these problems,” in effect giving them an entity or fixed-trait reason for their high score. A different third were told, “You must have worked hard at these problems,” implying an incremental theory of intelligence. The remaining children received no additional feedback. Presumably these children retain their native theory of intelligence, which in the general population is about 43% incremental and about 43% entity. (The rest do not fit clearly into either pattern.) Next, children were told they could do more problems, and were asked to choose what kind of problems they would like, as a measure of their achievement orientation. They were offered a choice of “Problems that aren’t too hard, so I don’t get many wrong,” “Problems that are pretty easy, so I’ll do well,” or “Problems that I’m pretty good at, so I can show that I’m smart” (p. 35). These first three options endorse performance goals and go along with an entity theory, spawning a desire to perform well in order to look intelligent. A fourth option endorsed a learning goal and thus an incremental theory: “Problems that I’ll learn a lot from even if I won’t look so smart.” After stating their preferred choice, children went on to instead do a second, more difficult set of problems that they were told the experimenter had previously chosen. Their own choices would be granted, the experimenter told them, if there was extra time at the end of the session. After completing the second set of problems, they were told they had performed a lot worse on it than on the first set. To check for the impact of the different kinds of success attribution feedback on response to this failure experience, children were next asked about their desire to take some more problems home with them, their enjoyment of the task, their perceptions about how they had done, and their attributions for how they had done. They were then given a third set of problems, which was moderately difficult, like the first set, to allow for an assessment of how the experimental intervention influenced performance. After this final task, all children were debriefed and told the second set of problems was much harder than the first, and was in fact designed for seventh-graders. The researchers ensured that all children felt proud of their performance before leaving the experiment. The results of this study are extremely interesting in terms of their implications for how rapidly children respond to feedback endorsing an entity or an incremental view. Regarding achievement motivation, 92% of the children who had received effort praise chose the learning goal after the first set of problems, by asking to receive additional problems that they would learn from. By comparison, just 8% of the children who had received the intelligence praise chose this option. The other 92% of the children who had received intelligence praise opted for problems that would be easy so they could look smart or do well. Among the children who had gotten no feedback, about half chose performance and half chose learning goals, in keeping with the baseline representation of entity and mastery theorists in the general U.S. population.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2270,"Children’s post-failure attributions after the second set of problems were also affected by the intervention. Those who had been praised for effort after the first problem set attributed their subsequent failure to diminished effort, whereas those who were praised for ability attributed their subsequent failure to lack of ability. Task enjoyment was also very much affected, with children who were praised for intelligence reporting less enjoyment of the task than children who were praised for effort. In terms of persistence, children praised for effort were more likely to want to take some additional problems home. Finally, performance on the third set of problems was also influenced by the intervention feedback after the first set. Children praised for effort did better on the third set of problems than they had on the first set, and children praised for intelligence performed worse. Children who had received no praise showed no change. Thus a single sentence of feedback attributing success to intelligence or effort was associated with a cascade of remarkably different reactions to a subsequent failure event. In five subsequent experiments, the researchers replicated and extended these basic findings. When people with an entity view of intelligence (enduring or induced by feedback) face failure, they attribute the failure to a fixed quality of the self. In the context of such an attribution, people avoid further challenge, instead seeking evidence that they are indeed smart. If brief experimenter feedback can have such a large impact on children, parent and teacher feedback, which continues over time and comes from people who are very important to a child, would be expected to have even more. As was discussed in chapter 5, even when teachers simply told children a test would show “how good you are in relation to other children your age,” children’s performance declined (Graham & Golan, 1991).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2271,"The studies just described show that a feedback event (or a short series of such events) can influence immediate reactions even in very young children. But mastery-oriented and helpless styles are not only temporary states of reaction to recent feedback. In the absence of particular feedback manipulations, children’s responses to challenging situations has been shown to remain stable from kindergarten until fifth grade (Ziegert, Kistner, Castro, & Robertson, 2001), and there is no reason to believe they change thereafter. The research suggests that how adults talk to children about their accomplishments has a host of important consequences. Dweck (1999) describes many other interesting outcomes and considerations regarding these two theories of self as malleable or fixed. The fact that adult feedback appears to push children toward adopting one or the other such view is what is important to the ideas of this chapter. Adult feedback that endorses a malleable view of intelligence is clearly better for children.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2272,"Consistent with Dweck’s findings, Dr. Montessori was against using any sort of entity evaluation of a child, positive or negative. “To tell a person he is clever or clumsy, bright or stupid, good or bad, is a form of betrayal. The child must see for himself what he can do, and it is important to give him not only the means of education but also to supply him with indicators which tell him his mistakes. . . .

Teachers were advised to have this sense about themselves, and to pass this sense on to children. An attitude that mistakes are valuable because we can learn from them is consistent with a mastery approach to learning and with an incremental theory of intelligence.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2274,"Not correcting children’s work was part of this incremental approach. Dr. Montessori held that children naturally correct their mistakes when they can perceive those mistakes, just as a baby corrects his or her own mistakes in learning to walk. A child learns through repetition of exercises where the mistakes are obvious, she claimed, not from an adult’s correcting his or her work. “What is meant by correcting exercise books? It means marking them from 0 to 10. How can a zero correct anyone’s defects?” (1967a, p. 245). Instead, Dr. Montessori counseled that correction comes from the child’s own observation of his mistakes in the outcome, and that the materials the child works with should make it obvious to the child when he has erred (see the discussion in chapter 5 on the Control of Error).",Montessori,Academic/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2275,"In this way the adult avoids passing judgment on the child and thus inadvertently promoting the performance goal of looking good for the adult. Having children find their own errors through the materials and work to master materials for their own sakes would be expected to lead to (or preserve) a mastery orientation in Montessori children. Dr. Montessori clearly valued intrinsic over performance reasons for one’s work: “If work comes from an inner source, it is much more intense and much more fruitful” (1989, p. 85). Whether Montessori children do have more of a mastery orientation toward schoolwork than do children in traditional school situations is a question for empirical study. Children in other nontraditional school systems clearly do (for example, Boaler, 1997; Boaler & Staples, 2003). Regardless, in counseling teachers never to give entity praise or criticism to children, Dr. Montessori’s recommendations for teachers are consistent with what self-theories research suggests will produce the most optimal child outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

In addition, when a child needs a break from work in Montessori, the child can take it. Children can stop and daydream for a time, pick up a recreational book, engage in free drawing, perhaps go outside and play, and so on. Of course, children are not free to abandon their education, and the teacher is responsible for noticing if a child is not using time wisely and intervening if needed.

excerpt_2280,"To the extent that children might interact with other children in traditional schooling arrangements, those others are usually of about the same age and ability. One might say that children are grouped in narrow bands. The first band is by age level: most of the children in the classroom are born within one year of each other, with a set birth date as the cut-off for being part of a classroom. Within each classroom, in many schools children are also grouped by ability level for each subject (“tracked”). By learning in this manner, children are removed from other children who are at very different levels. Their learning occurs in a narrow ability band. This is convenient to a factory model, since factories operate most efficiently if all of the raw materials are uniform. It suits the Lockean model of the child as well, since children at the same level are assumed to be alike and thus ready for the same knowledge to be poured in.",Traditional,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2281,"To examine this, researchers exposed toddlers to either a female adult or a 3-year-boy performing a variety of actions (Ryalls, Gul, & Ryalls, 2000). While sitting on their mothers’ laps, the children observed the model performing action sequences such as inserting a ball into a plastic egg, closing the egg, and shaking it. To see if they imitated the model’s actions, children were given the objects immediately and again after a one-week delay. Regardless of the delay time, children who had seen a slightly older peer model replicated a greater number of complex action sequences than did children exposed to an adult model, suggesting the peer elicited more imitation. This is a fascinating finding in need of replication. Because only one model was used for each condition, it is possible that some other difference in the models besides their peer/adult status was responsible for the result. We know, for example, that people are particularly apt to imitate those with whom they have better rapport (Bernieri, 1988), and perhaps children felt more rapport with the child for reasons other than age. More research is needed on this issue, using several different peer and adult models, but the finding is intriguing.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2282,"Montessori encourages learning from peers in part by using three-year age groupings. This ensures that as children move through the classroom they will be exposed to older and younger peers, facilitating both imitative learning and peer tutoring (discussed later). Dr. Montessori was quite clear about the need for this mix of ages: “The main thing is that the groups should contain different ages. . . . To have success you must have these different ages. . . . The older children are interested in the younger, and the younger in the older” (Montessori, 1989, pp. 68–69). A child enters the Primary classroom at 21 ⁄2 or 3 years of age and remains there until he or she has completed the “cycle of materials,” the full set of materials Dr. Montessori determined was optimal for a Primary classroom.

excerpt_2289,"The construct of attachment was first discussed by the British ethnologist and psychoanalyst John Bowlby (1969) as an explanation for the failure of many babies to thrive in European orphanages following World War II--they lacked a close relationship with an adult. According to attachment theory, children need a close adult who will function as a secure base from which to explore the world and a safe haven to which to retreat in times of stress. The psychologist Mary Ainsworth (1967), Bowlby’s colleague, moved the attachment construct from the theoretical to the empirical realm by establishing a method to assess attachment. Her method has been very important to our understanding of child development because it allows us to make reliable long-term predictions of child outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2290,"The paradigm Ainsworth devised to measure attachment is called the Strange Situation. The infant, usually between 12 and 18 months of age (the test may not be valid outside of that age range), is brought into a room full of toys with his or her mother. Over the next 15 or 20 minutes, the mother and a stranger come and go in a series of prearranged episodes. At one point the child is alone with the toys, then the door opens and in walks not the mother but the stranger. This is often very upsetting to the child, who usually already appeared stressed over being left alone. A moment later the mother returns, and the behavior of the child during this reunion is particularly diagnostic for attachment classification.",Traditional,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

For example, in one study, children whose attachment status had been classified when they were infants returned to the laboratory at 2 years of age to engage in some problem-solving tasks with their mothers.

For this measure, the child’s teacher or some other trained observer sorts preselected statements concerning a child’s possible profile into piles indicating whether the statements are more or less characteristic of the child. The statements are about such issues as how the child responds to fearful situations, the child’s predominant mood, and how often the child seeks proximity and comfort.

In one study, people who were tested in the Strange Situation as infants and as adults found that 72% of participants were classified with the convergent attachment styles at both time points (Waters, Merrick, Treboux, Crowell, & Albersheim, 2000). Thus, attachment is an enduring construct, applicable even beyond infancy.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2299,"Given the importance of the construct to predicting later competence and well-being, a pertinent question is what leads a child to have a particular type of relationship with the caregiver. Bowlby (1969) and Ainsworth (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) believed that an important antecedent factor in attachment style was adult sensitivity, and research has borne out that possibility (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Discussion following refers to maternal sensitivity because that was Ainsworth’s main concern, but the constructs seem to apply to any close caregiver. Important attachment relationships also of course develop with fathers (Grossmann et al., 2002), and they also appear to develop with day-care providers and teachers. Children growing up on Israeli kibbutzim become attached to their caregivers, and the quality of those relationships also predicts children’s outcomes (Oppenheim, Sagi, & Lamb, 1988). Children with a secure attachment to their kibbutz caregiver were later more goal directed and achievement oriented than were other children. This is consistent with work showing that American children’s relationships with their kindergarten teachers are related to their academic and behavioral outcomes through eighth grade (Hamre & Pianta, 2001).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2300,"Awareness requires that the mother be proximate to the infant so that she can perceive the infant’s signals. This aspect of attachment theory led to a concern beginning in the 1970s about whether babies placed in day care could become attached to their mothers. After many years of controversy, the recent National Study of Day Care, involving a representative sample of over 1,000 American children in a variety of day-care arrangements, has shown that use of day care has no significant impact on child-mother attachment relations (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). It is the mother’s awareness of signals when she is with the infant that appears to matter, and not that she is with the infant at all times. One might revise Ainsworth’s criteria for awareness, then, to read that the adult must be proximate to the infant for some reasonable amount of time, and when proximate, must be able to perceive the infant’s signals. A second aspect of awareness, besides proximity, is having a low perceiving threshold. The adult must notice the child’s signals.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2301,"The second major aspect of sensitivity for Ainsworth is accurate interpretation. Adults must interpret the babies’ signals for what they are, rather than distorting the signals in some way. Distortions could be caused by adults projecting their own needs on the infant, denying the infant’s needs because of their own needs, or any other biasing of the infant’s signals to accord with the adult’s own wishes and needs. Ainsworth noted that to overcome such proclivities, the adult must have self-insight. A second feature necessary to accurate interpretation, according to Ainsworth, is empathy. Adults who lack empathy, she said, would have detached, intellectual relations with babies instead of warm, sensitive ones. “A mother might be quite aware of and understand accurately the baby’s behavior and the circumstances leading to her baby’s distress or demands, but because she is unable to empathize with him -- unable to see things from the baby’s point to view--she may tease him back into good humor, mock him, laugh at him, or just ignore him” (Ainsworth, 1969, p. 2). Lack of empathy thus leads to inappropriate response.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2302,"Even correctly interpreted signals can be followed by inappropriate responses. The third main feature of sensitivity for Ainsworth is that the response to the perceived and accurately interpreted signal be an appropriate one. Ainsworth noted that in the first year, the appropriate response to the baby is almost always what the child “asks” for via his or her signals: pick the child up when the signal indicates a desire to be held, feed the child when the signal indicates hunger, and so on. After the first year, Ainsworth noted that doing exactly as the baby asks is no longer always the best response. As they get older, children increasingly need to adapt to the world, rather than always expecting the world to adapt to them. On the other hand, children also need to feel some sense of control or efficacy, as suggested by the research presented in chapter 3. Ainsworth advised that thebest response after age 1 is a compromise response that keeps the child’s long-range interests at heart.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2303,The final feature of sensitivity concerns timing of the response. Ainsworth noted that responses must be prompt to be effective. Adults who were devoted to a rigid feed or sleep schedule would be insensitive on this point. Responses need to be timed closely after the baby’s calls for attention for the baby to experience the efficacy of his or her actions.,Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2304,"Ainsworth’s theoretical ideas regarding sensitivity were compiled into a rating scale on which the sensitivity of primary caregivers to their children could be scored by trained observers watching mothers and children interact. Ainsworth’s original study of 23 mother-child pairs found a remarkably strong relationship between maternal sensitivity and child attachment classification (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Many studies have been done in the meantime, and the results are not as strong; some even fail to show a relationship. When results are inconsistent, the best response is a meta-analysis combining results across many studies. A recent meta-analysis of maternal sensitivity and attachment shows there is a relationship between the two factors, such that (in statistical terms) a child’s chances of being securely attached move from 38% if a mother is not sensitive to 62% if the mother is sensitive (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Because all scales and measures are prone to some degree of “measurement error,” the relationship in real terms might be stronger.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2305,"The issue of direction of effects naturally arises here. Perhaps the reason some mothers respond sensitively has to do with characteristics of the infant, and those infant characteristics lead to the later positive outcomes. In this view, the mother has no direct bearing on the child’s later outcomes. The obvious infant characteristic to consider is the child’s personality (or temperament), and studies have been done examining the relationship between child personality and attachment security (Vaughn & Bost, 1999). The upshot of these studies is that although personality predicts some aspects of behavior in the Strange Situation, it does not predict reunion behaviors, which are the most diagnostic of relationship quality.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2306,"One could still argue, however, that some aspect of the child is responsible for attachment classification. Experimental designs can address this. In fact, several intervention studies have been conducted, in which mothers were trained to respond more sensitively to their infants and changes in attachment classification following the intervention were examined. A recent meta-analysis of 88 intervention studies showed that short, focused interventions related to maternal sensitivity were effective both in making parents respond more sensitively to their infants and in changing infant attachment status (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van Ijzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). Such work strongly suggests that maternal sensitivity has a causal relationship to attachment classification.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2307,"Ainsworth’s rating scales were designed for observation of mothers with their infants. But a mother’s interaction style with a child evolves over time. Other research has looked at how parents of securely attached infants behave toward them somewhat later, as toddlers and preschoolers. One can view this as addressing how the sensitive pattern of responding adapts as children age. Mothers whose children were insecurely attached as infants tend to interact more intrusively with them in first and second grades (Egeland, Pianta, & O’Brien, 1993). Their interaction styles are more directive, such that they are more apt to tell their children exactly what to do. In contrast, parents of securely attached children tend not simply to tell the children what to do, but instead make suggestions, helping children to figure things out for themselves (Fagot, Gauvain, & Kavanagh, 1996; Frankel & Bates, 1990; Matas et al., 1978; Moss, 1992). They are closely involved, but nonintrusive. In Bruner’s (1975) terms, echoing Vygotsky, parents of securely attached children provide ideal scaffolds for children, structuring the environment such that children can internalize problem-solving strategies (see also Gauvain, 2001), whereas parents of insecurely attached children are more directive. Secure attachment styles in infancy are associated with parenting styles that evolve in positive ways as children get older.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2308,"Dr. Montessori advised that teachers show a degree of warmth and sensitivity that is reminiscent of the characteristics of parents whose children are securely attached. The focal period for forming attachment relationships (12 to 18 months) is of course usually prior to the age of entry into a Montessori classroom. Yet there is nothing to indicate that the adult behaviors associated with particular attachment styles cease to matter, and indeed those behaviors are consistent with literature suggesting optimal parenting practices for older children as well. As children get older, they still appear to need a safe haven and a secure base; they simply need it less often and feel comfortable venturing farther away.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2309,"Dr. Montessori saw the task of childhood as being to become increasingly independent, and the role of the adult as assisting children toward that independence. As is indicated in the quote above, Dr. Montessori maintained the teacher should serve as a safe haven whenever the child needs that. Yet when the child is ready to explore, the Montessori teacher was advised to be sensitive to the child’s need for increased independence, heeding the child’s call to “Help me to do it alone!” (Montessori, 1948/1976, p. 103).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2310,"To determine when a child needs a secure base, the Montessori teacher was advised to be very attentive to the children, with the observational acuity of a well-trained scientist. Indeed, Dr. Montessori (1917/1965) said, “The fundamental quality [teachers must possess was] a capacity for observation” (p. 130). Like the sensitive parents described by Ainsworth (1969), teachers’ thresholds for perceiving signals should be low. They should be trained to notice and correctly interpret the behavioral manifestations of the child’s inner state, in order to know what to do next. As is discussed later in the chapter with regard to teacher training, Dr. Montessori also advised teachers to develop self-understanding, so they do not misinterpret children’s signals in ways that align with their own needs.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2311,"When children are concentrating on work, Dr. Montessori held that they should be left alone, because during such moments, she believed, they are developing themselves. In chapter 3, I discussed the idea that concentration might be an engine of self-regulation, which is associated with many positive personality variables. Dr. Montessori saw concentration as the moment of self-development. Because of this theoretical stance, she held that teachers must watch for any concentrated purposeful movement, so as to let it go undisturbed; the child must be protected from stimuli that would break the concentration. For example, Dr. Montessori described an incident in which a child who had thus far been disorderly in school one day began to rearrange the furniture, with an expression of intense interest. The teacher was inclined to stop him, but Dr. Montessori saw his activity as coordinated toward a useful end, and manifesting that child’s first moments of concentration on purposeful activity in the classroom. According to Dr. Montessori, a sensitive teacher would leave a child alone in such actions, as long as the child was not disturbing others.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2312,"The Montessori teacher must also be sensitive to when the child is ready for something new, because “the brain always asks for work which becomes more complex” (Montessori, 1989, p. 89). After great concentration a child may need to rest or simply observe others (Montessori, 1989, p. 19), but at a certain point the child will be ready for more complex work. The teacher must be attuned to such moments, and give the child new work when the child is ready. Further, like parents of securely attached children in problem-solving situations, the Montessori teacher must structure the environment in such a way that children can make discoveries on their own. Telling children, as traditional teaching often involves, is associated with insecure attachment relationships.",Montessori,Cognitive/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2313,"Children with insecure attachments have parents who behave in two opposing ways. Parents of insecure-resistantly attached children seem to frequently interfere with the child, and fail to give the child independence when the child needs it.

excerpt_2314,"Dr. Montessori appears to have explicitly advised against both of these errors well in advance of the research on attachment: “We must never force our caresses on him, greatly as we may be attracted by his fascinating graces; nor must we ever repel his outbursts of affection, even when we are not disposed to receive them, but must respond with sincere and delicate devotion” (1917/1965, p. 332).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Behaviorist approaches, notably that of Thorndike, specified that the teacher’s role was to establish useful bonds in the child’s mind and eliminate useless and negative ones. Being businesslike was important in this approach as well; such concepts as “emotional warmth” do not figure prominently in behaviorist discourse; in the rare instances when Thorndike mentions emotional qualities for a teacher, it tends to be in a footnote (e.g., Thorndike, 1906/1962, p. 63). Thorndike’s recommendation for how a teacher should give instructions, for example, was to say, “Do the work on this page. Do it again, keeping track of how many minutes you spend. Practice again until you can get all the answers right in 12 minutes” (Thorndike, 1921b, p. 17). Communication was to be simple, direct, and dry.

In fact, Montessori’s decline from an initial period of great popularity in the United States around 1920 is often attributed to the writing of education professor William Kilpatrick (1914), who opposed Montessori’s introduction of reading and writing to children before they reach the age of 6 and is discussed further in chapter 10. Books at such an early age were deemed harmful by several of Montessori’s contemporaries. Montessori clearly has high academic and behavioral expectations of children, which Dr. Montessori would say are the result of children themselves indicating what they were capable of and drawn to when free within a specially prepared environment.",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

If children can imagine fairy tales, she wrote, why not ask them to imagine parts of the real earth that they cannot see? Children apparently surprised her repeatedly by showing interest in real activities over play, and she responded by creating an educational system that expects maturity, as do authoritative parents. This can put people off, because they see Montessori education as not being sufficiently fun. Empirical research should more directly address this issue, but the Middle School study mentioned previously (Rathunde & Csikszentmihalyi, in press) and other work concerning children’s motivation and affect when engaged in Montessori-like practices (collaborative learning, lack of extrinsic rewards, and so) in traditional settings suggest that it is probably not a concern. Children do appear to enjoy learning in the circumstances of Montessori classrooms.",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2339,"As was discussed earlier, Dr. Montessori advised that adults show great emotional warmth when dealing with children. Children must have “a teacher who looks on them with love and hope” (Montessori, 1989, p. 79). Yet at the same time, the adult’s ultimate control of the environment was clearly a high priority. The pitfalls of permissive adult attitudes were pointed out in her writing. “If freedom is understood as letting the children do as they like, using or more likely misusing, the things available, it is clear that only their ‘deviations’ are free to develop” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 206). Permissive parents are often thought of as ones who want to be their children’s friends; it is hard for them to exercise authority. Dr. Montessori saw the dangers in this: “The teacher must be superior and not just a friend. . . . [Children] need a dignified, mature person. . . . If they have no authority, they have no directive. Children need this support” (1989, p. 17). Some Montessori teachers, like some parents, err in this regard. They do not provide ultimate control over the environment, deal effectively with unproductive behaviors, or guide children’s decisions in positive ways. Freedom can thus be taken to an extreme, and Dr. Montessori counseled against this repeatedly. “One time I saw an entire class of disorganized children who were using the materials completely wrongly. The teacher drifted about in the class, silent as the Sphinx. . . . This teacher was committing a grave error: She feared disturbing their disorder, instead of attempting to establish the order” (Montessori, 1956, p. 140).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2340,"Another not uncommon error in Montessori teaching is the opposite one: for teachers to be overly rigid about the method, in a manner reminiscent of authoritarian parents. Dr. Montessori also spoke against an authoritarian stance: “The teacher can address the pupil energetically and severely and thus jolt him out of his behavior, but those who know their jobs well have means more effective than coercion for recalling the pupil to order” (1956, p. 141). Authoritarian parents tell children to do things because the parent says so; they do not reason with the child, and they appear to take on a stance that they are infallible. Yet adults who work with children have to admit to being fallible (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246). Education, she said, was traditionally “directed toward the suppression or bending of the child’s will, and the substitution for it of the teacher’s will, which demands from the child unquestioning obedience” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 252). Against the behaviorist trend, she said, “We cannot directly mold. . . . individual forms of character, intelligence, and feeling” (1917/1965, p. 9).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

They should provide an appropriately structured environment in which children are free to make their own decisions and discoveries.

Still, my guess is that a new class of children in the same school would not strongly affect a teacher’s responses and that teachers were the main causal factor in children’s responses. In addition, in chapter 3 I mentioned a study in which teachers were trained to give children more control in the classroom, and positive changes were observed in their students (De Charms, 1976).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_2344,"The current swing toward external testing standards promotes the opposite behaviors in teachers. In one study, when teachers were told their students would have to pass specific educational standards, teachers became more controlling, talked and commanded more, gave students less choice and autonomy, and expressed more criticism of students (Deci, Spiefel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kaufman, 1982). Both as children get older, and when standardized testing is emphasized, teachers in traditional schools become more prone to create classroom environments that are at odds with more optimal child outcomes. In the context of traditional education, teachers can attempt to overcome the negative effects of grades and testing, and the inherently competitive, comparative system they create. The system, however, was designed for their use, and as the current enthusiasm for high-stakes testing shows, as a culture we keep returning to it.

First, as was discussed with reference to authoritative parenting, Montessori teachers’ expectations are high.

The Montessori teacher’s goal is clearly the child’s self-regulation; the teacher’s task was well done when the teacher was needed only to give additional lessons. “Any pedagogical action, if it is to be efficacious in the training of little children, must tend to help the children to advance upon this road of independence” (Montessori, 1912/1964, p. 97).

Before concentration occurs, the directress may do more or less what she thinks best; she may interfere with the children’s activities as much as she thinks necessary” (1967a, p. 278).

She recommended doing so by redirection rather than punishment. “Interfere by all means to stop disturbances, but we need not punish or scold or admonish when we stop bad behavior; we can ask the child to come and pick flowers in the garden or offer a toy or any occupation that will appeal to [the child]” (Montessori, 1989, p. 16).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

In the AMI Montessori teacher training courses, scores of hours are spent with children, observing their actions, recording those observations, and crafting them into reports to be reviewed by the teacher trainer. Dr. Montessori advocated training in science, rather than in education, for people who would go into Montessori teaching, in part because training in science is training in close observation (Montessori, 1917/1965, p. 138). She was also concerned that training in traditional education might make it more difficult to become a good Montessori teacher. “An ordinary teacher cannot be transformed into a Montessori teacher, but must be created anew, having rid herself of pedagogical prejudices” (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 87).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2359,"Teachers had to rid themselves of pride and anger, to become humble and charitable, and to “check those inner attitudes characteristic of adults that can hinder our understanding of a child” (Montessori, 1966, p. 153). This is reminiscent of Ainsworth’s discussion of sensitivity, in which the sensitive mother is free from distortions caused by her own needs and desires, a state that aids her in seeing the child’s signals for what they are. This emphasis on one’s personal preparation to be a teacher contrasts sharply with traditional teacher training, which focuses more on how one does things than on one’s own psychology. In fact, the Montessori approach is more in keeping with training psychoanalysts, since they must go through analysis themselves first.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2360,"To teach about the material and its presentation, AMI teacher training generally requires nine months of lecture with internships in a variety of Montessori classrooms and observation time intermingled. The teacher trainer oversees the trainee’s learning of lessons and supervises the internships and observations. Lectures and practicums enable trainees to learn about the materials and the variety of ways in which they can be used to stimulate interest and use, as well as the interconnections between materials across the curriculum. Trainees learn to present the materials, with all the variations, to children (by practicing on the trainer and fellow trainees prior to internships).",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2361,"For this reason as well, as was described earlier, AMI training also involves making several “albums,” normally three-ring binders of typed and illustrated pages describing everything one has been presented during the course. Effectively, the Montessori teacher-in-training writes his or her own textbook concerning Montessori materials and theory. The knowledge in these albums is of course not as deep and thorough as that of the teacher trainer, just as the notes of a student taking a college course would not reflect all the knowledge of the professor, but they are sufficiently thorough to allow the teacher to refer to them over the coming years, and to guide his or her lessons in the future. Some other Montessori teacher training courses routinely give teachers copies of the information rather than having them write and illustrate it themselves. This is not a good change: research has shown that taking one’s own notes leads to better learning than does reading prewritten ones (Annis, 1981; Kulhavy, Dyer, & Silver, 1975).",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Half of the subjects were told they could terminate the noise at anytime with a switch, but they were discouraged from doing so and few people actually used the switch, whereas others were simply subjected to the loud noise, with no suggestion that they could control it. Even though they had not opted to control the noise, those who believed themselves able to control it noticed significantly more errors on the proofreading task and were significantly more persistent in their attempts to solve the tangram puzzles.

The manipulation of interest was a pretreatment of uncontrollable noise, as opposed to controllable noise. After a period in which they heard noise which they believed they could escape, participants were subsequently significantly more likely to discover the pattern in the anagrams.

There were people called the Rope Stretchers whose job was to create the property lines again, work so important it was supervised by the pharaoh himself.

The sides of the ropes, when stretched into a scalene (right-angle) triangle, are 3x, 4x, and 5x. As the story goes, Pythagoras was visiting Egypt and saw the Rope Stretchers at work and learned there the principles of the famous theorem that bears his name. The idea of angles is thus tied to a piece of history and geography, and it is a hands-on activity involving one’s classmates and imaginary tracts of land that must be divided up, all of which appears to stimulate interest and inspire them to learn not only about geometry, but also the Egyptians, the Nile, Egyptian numerals and their derivation, history, and so on.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Interest in Human Learning,excerpt_dataset,

The child’s task is to find the toy in the larger room, given information about the whereabouts of the toy in the model. Children under 2½ tend to fail this problem, searching randomly for big Snoopy, apparently failing to understand the small space as a symbol for the larger one. There is a rapid period of transition at the end of the third year; by age 3, most children go immediately to the pillow and find big Snoopy.",Montessori,Academic/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Meaningful Contexts for Learning,excerpt_dataset,

Performance declines, for example, if one changes the slipcovers on the furniture, or the shape of the table, making the similarity between the two spaces less obvious (see also Gentner & Toupin, 1986). Surface similarity assists children’s ability to see relations between two spaces and to apply knowledge acquired in one space to another space.

When later tested on the lists, those who studied in the same place in which they were tested remembered about 40% more words than those who switched contexts.

If children could read the name on a card, she promised, they could play with the toy as a reward. Like many adults, she assumed rewards were positive and even necessary to get children to engage in difficult tasks. The children, however, showed her differently. They eagerly read the words, but showed no interest in the toys, asking instead for another word to read. This suggested to her that a challenging activity, reading (for new readers), could be motivating in and of itself.

The structural organization involved was a diorama of a miniature town, into which 20 small items, including animals, cars, people, and so on, were logically placed while the children, Maya and American 8- and 9-year-olds, looked on. The 20 objects were then replaced into the pool of 80 items from which they were drawn, and the children were asked to reconstruct the scene. Although the Maya sample had shown much poorer memory previously on a standard list task, their performance was even slightly better than that of the American children in this organized task. Although children learn to memorize lists of unrelated items in Traditional schools, one might question whether this is a good use of their processing resources.Transitive inference tasks are ones in which one learns that A > B and B > C, and one must infer that A > C.

When the child did not see the object under the first pillow, the child gave up. Piaget then showed the child how he had moved the object, and repeated the procedure. The child behaved in exactly the same way, whereupon Piaget lifted the second pillow and asked, ""Didn’t you see I put it here?"" (on the prior hiding trial). ""Yes,"" his child replied, ""but it should be there"" (pointing to the first pillow) (Montessori, 1966, pp. 53–54).

excerpt_2533,"Dr. Montessori described an early case in which it became apparent to her that children’s tendency to imitate others can be a useful source of inlearning from peers 197 spiration in school, advancing children to new abilities. This observation, called the “explosion” into writing, recurs annually in well-functioning Montessori Primary classrooms when the first 4-year-old suddenly realizes, after months of working with the preparatory materials, that he or she can write. “The first word to be written by one of them brought a great outburst of joy and laughter. Everyone looked admiringly at ‘the writer,’ and thus they felt moved to follow his example. ‘I can do it too!’ they cried. The achievement of one started off the whole group” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 231). Other 4-year-olds, having also been indirectly prepared to write through the use of knobs on Wooden Cylinders and other materials, pencils in Metal Insets, and so on, as was described in chapter 1, spontaneously began writing in reaction to having observed a first child reaching that landmark. Obviously children also see others learn to write in traditional schools; what is unique in Montessori is the series of steps, all visible and imitable, that lead children along the path to writing, so that a community of 4-year-olds can discover they already have the ability to write once they see it done by another child.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2534,"Children also can learn about social behavior in Montessori classrooms by observing how others behave in natural, nonscripted situations. Whereas in traditional classrooms, children learn how to sit still and listen to the teacher, in Montessori, they can learn how to interact with each other. The oldest children in the classroom can serve as examples to the younger ones. “The undisciplined child enters into discipline by working in the company of others, not by being told that he is naughty” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246).",Montessori,Social,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2535,". Dr. Montessori also noted that by observing older children, younger ones can see what they will later be able to do themselves, and that this is motivating. “To understand what the older ones are doing fills the little ones with enthusiasm” (1967a, p. 228).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2536,"One might wonder how learning by observation in a Montessori classroom is possible for the oldest children, who are working at the highest levels with many of the available materials. Facilitating their learning by observation, Dr. Montessori urged that children be allowed to visit other classrooms. “The classroom for those of three to six is not even rigidly separated from that of the children from seven to nine. Thus, children of six can get ideas from the class above. . . . One can always go for an intellectual walk!” (1967a, p 227).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2537,"In contrast, in traditional schools, people’s sense is usually that smaller classes are better for children. Research on this is actually equivocal, at least as regards achievement (Ehrenberg, Brewer, Gamoran, & Willms, 2001).",Traditional,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2538,"Anecdotally, Montessorians report that when more than one adult is active in a classroom, children are less apt to work independently and with each other, but turn instead to an adult. Other arguments for a single teacher, such as integration of knowledge, were discussed in chapter 4.",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2539,"One study of the efficacy of such a system (“Classwide Peer Tutoring”) involved first- and second-grade classrooms in low-income schools (Greenwood et al., 1987). Classrooms were randomly assigned to tutoring and control conditions for spelling. In control classrooms, teachers used standard methods of teaching spelling: a workbook with word lists and vocabulary exercises, chalkboard, self-study, and homework assignments. In classrooms that used the tutoring program, the tutoring process described earlier replaced some in-class spelling work. Over the two years of the study, children in the peer tutoring classrooms were spelling 87% of the words correctly on average, whereas children in other classrooms were spelling 75% of words correctly. This is not an enormous difference, but it is certainly a meaningful one. Peering tutoring programs also appear to confer many social benefits on the classroom (Fantuzzo, Riggio, Connelly, & Dimeff, 1989; Maheady & Sainato, 1985). In addition, they apparently benefit learning other topics and over the long term",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2540,"In one demonstration of these benefits, a follow-up study expanded the peer tutoring to cover reading, math, and language, and examined children’s performance over multiple years. Children in the tutoring program performed significantly better than those in the control group on all three topics both immediately and two years later, when they had moved on to middle school and no longer had the program. They also performed better in two nontutored topics: science and social studies. They even performed as well as children in a higher SES group in all these areas (Greenwood et al., 1989). In addition, fewer children from the peer tutoring group were placed in special-education classes (Greenwood, Terry, Utley, Montagna, & Walker, 1993). This study is among many suggesting that peer tutoring programs, appropriately structured, improve learning in traditional schools and that the benefits extend across time and topics (see Topping & Ehly, 1998).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2541,"Peer tutoring programs vary in terms of how structured each tutoring session is, and more structured programs are typically associated with greater success. Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) is an example of a more structured tutoring program (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998), and it has also been used to examine the effect of rewards. RPT begins with training sessions about teamwork and cooperation, and children are told they can win rewards by using teamwork. In the RPT program, teaching aides show the children how to tutor each other. Then RPT sessions are held twice weekly for 45 minutes each. Special flash-card materials are used, with a problem on one side and steps to the solution on the other. Children decide who will be tutor first in each session, and work for 10 minutes on problems before switching roles. After the initial 20 minutes, problem drill sheets are administered, and students attempt the problems, then switch papers with partners for correction. Performance on the drill sheets accrues points, which lead to such rewards as being teacher’s helper or working on a special project. When children were randomly assigned to RPT versus traditional instruction groups, those in the RPT groups consistently showed higher levels of mathematics achievement (Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-Block, 1998). Two alternative groups were also formed, one with the reward but lacking the structure provided by the flash cards, and the other having the structure but no reward. The combination of rewards and structure led to the most gains in both achievement and positive social behavior. Structure alone, without rewards, was associated with better behavior both in the tutoring sessions and in the regular classroom situation. Students also perceived themselves to be more competent when using structured than when using unstructured tutoring, but achievement was not improved in the absence of rewards (Fantuzzo, King, & Heller, 1992). Thus, within a traditional school environment, more structured peer interactions with a reward structure optimized learning and behavior. The issue of rewards is important and is discussed further in the context of collaborative learning.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2542,"Although supplementing whole-class teaching with peer tutoring improves achievement, adults are even more effective tutors than peers. The research suggests several reasons for this that shed light on how peer tutoring can be most effective. First, adults structure the task in ways that keep the overarching goal in clear focus, whereas child partners tend to focus on parts of the problem, losing sight of the whole--a difference reminiscent of the differences between same-age experts and novices. For example, if the task is planning a route for doing a set of errands as efficiently as possible, child pairs will get the errands done, but not as efficiently, because they focus on each individual item to be retrieved separately, rather than thinking about how several items can be grouped to make for more efficient routes. Adult tutors get children to think about grouping items. However, when the peer tutor is trained in this task and taught to consider how to group items, tutee performance does improve. Nonetheless, performance even with a trained peer tutor does not improve to the level obtained when the tutor was an adult (Gauvain, 2001).",Montessori,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2543,"A second probable reason for the greater success of adult tutors is that adults tend to include children more in the task at hand. Other children can become autocratic, as children are inclined to focus on who gets to do what. Children tend to like to do; adults more easily sit back, watch, and guide. Research has shown that peer learning is also more successful when peers listen to each other and question each other more (reviewed below), skills that many adults have but many children have not yet learned (Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2544,"Perhaps in part because peer tutors can become autocratic, some research suggests that, when tutored by a peer, the tutee benefits maximally from a peer who is just a bit more advanced rather than much more advanced. For example, research on both scientific and moral reasoning has shown that children benefit from exposure to thought processes that are just above their current level (Damon & Killen, 1982; Kuhn, 1972; Turiel & Rothman, 1972)",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2545,"Besides being less able to adapt to a lower level of tutee, much older and more advanced peer tutors sometimes practice social dominance. The problems of autocracy mentioned earlier thus become exacerbated, and the tutee learns less, because he or she is less involved in the decision-making process. This was found in a study in which 5-year-old novices were paired either with 5- or 7-year-olds who were considered experts at planning routes (as in the study just described) (Duran & Gauvain, 1993). Children were more involved with the task when paired with an advanced planner of their own age, as opposed to an older planner, and this increased involvement predicted better performance. Whether the particular age gap used in this experiment (5 to 7) is a particularly problematic one would be an interesting topic for research. The age of 6 is a pivotal one, recognized in many of the world’s cultures as an appropriate time to ask more of children, such as by beginning formal schooling (Rogoff, 1981). Six is the age at which Piaget speculated children advance to being able to perform mental operations (for example, imagining addition and subtraction), and which Dr. Montessori considered transitional between her first and second planes of development. At each plane, she said, children think differently. Examining whether 6- and 8-, or 7- and 9-year-olds, make more effective tutoring pairs would be of interest. The research suggests that peers who are slightly advanced, but not too advanced, make more optimal tutors, but it might also be the case that tutors who are within particular age spans are best",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

Students who both prepared to teach and went on actually to teach showed the highest levels of understanding of the passage, those who prepared to teach but did not performed next best, and those who read to be tested performed worst of all.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2547,"Even 3-year-olds appear to benefit from teaching. Children were given three pairs of problem stories with conceptually similar solutions (Brown & Kane, 1988). For example, one story involved a man who needed to stack tires on a high shelf, and the solution was to stack tires to use as a step stool. After hearing the first story, children who did not solve it spontaneously (about 80% of them) were shown the solution. The second story was about a man who needed to get hay bales on a high tractor--a problem that could also be solved by stacking items. Some children were simply told the story, whereas others were asked to teach the solution to a Kermit the Frog puppet. Children who taught Kermit the Frog spontaneously came up with the solution to the second story of the pairs twice as frequently as children who were simply read the story",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

Several studies show that people learn better when working collaboratively than when working alone (Azmitia & Crowley, 2001; P. A.

excerpt_2549,"The psychologist Elliot Aronson designed the Jigsaw program initially to address the disturbances that followed the integration of public schools in Austin, Texas, in the 1960s (Aronson & Patnoe, 1997). He reasoned that close student contact, for the purpose of helping others, might alleviate problems, and so created learning arrangements that would lead to such contact. In the Jigsaw model, children are placed in groups of five or six and topics of study are broken into as many segments. For the topic of the Civil War, for example, one person might be assigned to study the history of slavery, another the type of weapons used in the era, another the major battles, 210 Montessori and so on. Children research their topic on their own, and then temporarily join a new group composed of the child from every other group in the class who was assigned their same topic. These “homogenous” groups share information and practice presentations of their topics. Finally, children reunite with their original groups, and each child teaches the material. A test on all the material generally follows. The Jigsaw method has repeatedly been found to improve learning as well as classroom social relations (Aronson, 2002; Bridgeman, 1981; Lazarowitz, Hertz-Lazarowitz, & Baird, 1994). In terms of academic achievement, it is particularly successful with minority youths, but in some cases it has improved, and in no cases (to my knowledge) has it negatively affected, the learning of other students (Lucker, Rosenfield, Sikes, & Aronson, 1977; Slavin, 1983).",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,

Ten- and 11-year-olds were assigned to one of four conditions, crossing “working in pairs/alone” with “encouraged to talk/not,” and asked to 212 Montessori solve puzzles, such as to determine how a spaceship moved or to decipher the effect of using a particular function key on a computer. Children who worked together and were encouraged to talk were most likely to solve the puzzles and produced the most interpretive talk. Even when children were alone and encouraged to talk to themselves, their use of interpretive talk was positively related to their ability to solve the puzzles. Descriptive talk, which is more characteristic of children in the kindergarten years, was associated with low levels of performance on the problem-solving tasks. The children who performed the worst were ones who worked alongside others but were discouraged from talking at all, which is the typical arrangement in traditional elementary schools. In contrast, children at these ages in Montessori schools tend to work together, and they frequently talk while they work.

After each child had drawn for six minutes, a Good Player Award was placed with great fanfare on an ""Honor Roll Board."" For the other two conditions, children were simply allowed to draw with the markers for six minutes and then were unexpectedly given a Good Player Award, or they drew for six minutes and no award was ever mentioned.

Then they were told they would read a second passage, with directions that varied by condition. Some children were told, ""After you are finished, I’m going to test you on it. I want to see how much you can remember. You should work as hard as you can, because I’ll be grading you on the test to see if you’re learning well enough."" Another group of children was told, ""After you are finished, I’ll be asking you some questions similar to the ones I just asked about the other passage."" Recall that these questions were about their personal reactions to the passages. After answering the questions about interest, pressure, and difficulty for the second reading, the children were asked to recall as much of the second 160 Montessori passage as they could. To test for conceptual learning, they were also asked to write an essay on the main point of the passage. To test long-term retention, a week later, children were asked to once again recall the second passage by rote and to write an essay describing the passage’s main point. The results were highly suggestive of what expectations about getting a grade do for learning. Students who thought they would be graded rendered the passage by rote best at the first test, but had also forgotten the most a week later, making their long-term retention equal to that of the children who thought they would be questioned only about their personal reactions. At second testing, the ""personal-reaction"" children retained almost all of the rote information reported at the first session. But rote learning is usually not what we really value, after all. Conceptual learning--drawing the main point from what we read--is much more important, and the results here are compelling. The essays of the students who did not expect a test or a grade showed significantly greater conceptual learning than did the essays of the children who did expect one. The upshot is that students who expect to be tested initially learn the facts better, by rote, but as soon as the test is over, they forget much of what they learned.

Correct solutions to the first 9 problems all involved a particular pattern of use of three jugs, but a correct solution to the 10th one involved just two jugs, so the 10th problem was a set breaker: it required that the participant break a response set to consider a problem in a new way. What was of interest was not whether problems were solved correctly, since that was expected, but instead how long it took to solve them, particularly the set breaker. Whereas participants in both groups took equally long on the initial 9 items, the set-breaking 10th problem took participants in the nonreward condition only about half as long to solve as the participants who were trying for the $1 bonus.

Before beginning the task, some children were given an advance reward: they were allowed to take two pictures with an instant camera if they promised to later participate in other activities. To cement this promise, they signed an elaborate vow to later write the story. Other children also took two pictures before writing their story, but it was not construed as an advance reward. A second manipulation was that for half of the children in each group, the activities were labeled play, and for half they were labeled work. The researchers expected that the play label would be associated with higher creativity. The results indicated no significant effect of the work or play label on creativity, but a significant effect of how the picture taking was construed.

Some students were told that the researchers were interested in the quality of their collages, whereas others were told that the researchers were only interested in the mood that resulted from working on the collage. Of those who were told the quality of collage was important, some were told the specific criteria by which collage extrinsic rewards and motivation 163 quality would be judged. A team of 15 judges with extensive studio art experience evaluated the collages for those criteria, such as novelty of material use, novelty of idea, effort evident, variation of shapes, detail, and complexity.

Judges rated the quality of the drawings of the noncompetitive group more highly. Motivation and interest in the task were also affected, such that children in the competing group were less likely to want to engage in the activity again (see also White & Owen, 1970).

A second opportunity to sort papers arose later, while waiting for the experimenter to find a tape recorder. During this time, other activities such as reading comic books were also available. Children’s mothers also contributed to the data by describing how they used rewards for their children’s behaviors at home and how prosocial their children were. Children in the reward condition spent significantly less time sorting paper during the second, free-choice period than did children who did not receive a reward. Therefore motivation to subsequently engage in prosocial acts was negatively impacted by a prior expected reward. A particularly interesting finding is the relationship between mothers’ habitual use of rewards and children’s responses. Children whose mothers reported that they liked and used extrinsic rewards at home were most affected by the reward manipulation. They sorted significantly less paper, on average, and fewer than half of them sorted any paper at all at the second opportunity. Children whose mothers did not use rewards at home were much less impacted by rewards, and 85% of them helped by sorting paper. Finally, it was also reported that the children of mothers who felt positively about the use of extrinsic incentives for prosocial behavior engaged in less prosocial behavior at home than did the children of the other mothers.",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,

excerpt_2586,"One interesting study examined the impact of grades on self theories, goals, and performance in sixth-graders using tasks with both fixed and open-ended solutions (Butler & Nisan, 1986). Some of the fixed-solution tests were word games, such as making as many words as possible from the letters of a long word and constructing new words using the first and last letters of a prior word. The open-ended tasks included a ""creative uses"" task in which one comes up with as many uses as possible for an object, and a ""circles"" task, in which one is given a page of nickel-sized circles to draw on, and the creativity of one’s drawings is rated. All children performed similarly on a pre-test composed of these tasks. Two days later, some of the children were surprised by the return of their test booklets with either verbal feedback specifying how they could have performed better (""You wrote many short words, but not many long ones"") or a score. All of the children then engaged in slightly different versions of the same tasks. A third session two hours later repeated the original tasks, and children answered questions regarding their motivation on the tasks and the sources of their performance. An important factor to remember for the results of these experiments is that they were conducted in the children’s school classroom, in a manner reminiscent of school assignments. By sixth grade, students have learned that what one does in school is important only when there is evaluative extrinsic rewards and motivation 167 feedback. Unfortunately, university students often appear to feel the same way, visibly going on vacation when told something will not be on the exam. In keeping with this, students who had not gotten their test booklets back before the second session (no feedback) did not perform as well as the others on the later tests. They probably did not see the assignment as important and did not put in effort. Consistent with other studies, the two different kinds of feedback led to differences in performance on the open-ended tasks (not on the fixedsolution ones). For example, students who received verbal feedback about how to do better thought of more uses for objects later than did students who had received grades. In addition, students who received comments reported higher levels of motivation on and more liking for the tasks than did those who received grades. What was new about this study was that grades and comments also had different impacts on what the students felt contributed to their performance: their theories of intelligence. Students who received comments attributed their performance to effort, interest, and skill, whereas students who received grades were more apt to attribute their performance to the reader’s mood: an external, uncontrollable variable. If one has an incremental theory, skill is something one can control. The reader’s mood, on the other hand, is outside one’s control. The literature on learned helplessness and issues discussed in chapter 3 arise. As was discussed there, entity theorists tend to feel helpless in the face of failure. Attributions of effort aligned with these different perceptions of what underlay their performance. Students in the grades group attributed their effort to a desire to avoid failure, whereas those who received comments attributed their effort to their interest in the task. The entity theorists’ performance goals are thus apparent in the group who received grades. Grades and other evaluations, then, undermine motivation perhaps in part because they tend to lead to performance goals instead of mastery ones. Grades appear to lead children to view their level of performance as reflecting their being smart or dumb, not as indicative of having studied hard or not.",Traditional,Academic,Study,excerpt,Extrinsic Rewards and Motivation,excerpt_dataset,

Children were randomly assigned to groups and for each group, instruction using the same example problems was couched in contexts designed to have different interest appeal. For the abstract group, all of the instruction examples were presented with general referents (""solid, liquid"") without any meaningful background theme. For example, one item read, ""There are three objects. Each is cut in one-half. In all, how many pieces would there be?"" (p. 73). The concrete group received hypothetical but concrete referents, for example stating that Bill had three candy bars, each of which he cut in half. The third group had examples that were intended to be most interesting, because they were personalized to concern matters of subjective importance, such as one’s birthday, teachers and friends, hobbies, and so on. For example, their teacher (mentioned by name) presented them with three Mars bars (their favorite candy) on their birthday, and if they cut each candy bar in half, how many friends could they share with? As bookends to these lessons, children took pre- and post-tests of their understanding of fractions. The results were clear in supporting that children learn best when the material is of personal interest. On the post-test, the abstract group scored lowest (averaging 2 of 11 problems correct), the concrete next-lowest (3.5 of 11), and the personalized group had the highest score (6 of 11).

The results showed that these students advanced dramatically in math, from the 30th to the 70th percentile, during the year of the intervention.

It was found that children’s achievement across the three years was directly related to the level of interest and excitement they expressed when engaged in the activity at the first time point.

Children in the control condition saw the game in an unembellished, rather banal format, with the title of ‘Math Game.’ For the other children, the game was presented within a spaceship fantasy context and either had the title ‘Space Quest’ and involved the child imagining she or he was piloting a spaceship to other planets to save Earth from an energy crisis, or else had the title ‘Treasure Hunt,’ and involved imagining he or she was the captain of a ship seeking buried treasure. Some children also had personalized games that began with the child’s name (‘Best of luck in your journey, Commander Christy’) and sent the child off on the journey with his or her own personal favorite foods. Children played these games three times at school over a two-week period, for 30 minutes each time. A week later they were tested on their knowledge of the use of parentheses in arithmetic expressions as well as their knowledge of arithmetic operations in a different context. Their enjoyment of the game, their own assessment of their performance, and their desired level of challenge in future games were also assessed. The results were quite clear. When interesting contexts had been provided, children showed better knowledge of how parentheses affect arithmetic operations and were better able to transfer that knowledge to non-computer contexts. Personalization augmented these effects. In addition, students’ motivation was clearly influenced by the manipulation. Students in the context conditions were much more likely to opt for the computer playing its best game, liked the game more, were more willing to stay after school to play the game, believed themselves to be better at the games, and indicated they would seek a more challenging game later.

Such people view mistakes as learning opportunities, and when they err, they continue to engage in the task with the aim of mastering it.

excerpt_2608,"In the first experiment, children were given three sets of problems to solve. The first set was a moderately difficult one, so all the children did fairly well. At that point, all of the children were told, “Wow, you did very well on these problems.” No matter how they had actually done, all the children were told they had gotten 80% right. “That’s a really high score.” (Children were “debriefed” about the experiment later.) Then, roughly a third of the children were told, “You must be smart at these problems,” in effect giving them an entity or fixed-trait reason for their high score. A different third were told, “You must have worked hard at these problems,” implying an incremental theory of intelligence. The remaining children received no additional feedback. Presumably these children retain their native theory of intelligence, which in the general population is about 43% incremental and about 43% entity. (The rest do not fit clearly into either pattern.) Next, children were told they could do more problems, and were asked to choose what kind of problems they would like, as a measure of their achievement orientation. They were offered a choice of “Problems that aren’t too hard, so I don’t get many wrong,” “Problems that are pretty easy, so I’ll do well,” or “Problems that I’m pretty good at, so I can show that I’m smart” (p. 35). These first three options endorse performance goals and go along with an entity theory, spawning a desire to perform well in order to look intelligent. A fourth option endorsed a learning goal and thus an incremental theory: “Problems that I’ll learn a lot from even if I won’t look so smart.” After stating their preferred choice, children went on to instead do a second, more difficult set of problems that they were told the experimenter had previously chosen. Their own choices would be granted, the experimenter told them, if there was extra time at the end of the session. After completing the second set of problems, they were told they had performed a lot worse on it than on the first set. To check for the impact of the different kinds of success attribution feedback on response to this failure experience, children were next asked about their desire to take some more problems home with them, their enjoyment of the task, their perceptions about how they had done, and their attributions for how they had done. They were then given a third set of problems, which was moderately difficult, like the first set, to allow for an assessment of how the experimental intervention influenced performance. After this final task, all children were debriefed and told the second set of problems was much harder than the first, and was in fact designed for seventh-graders. The researchers ensured that all children felt proud of their performance before leaving the experiment. The results of this study are extremely interesting in terms of their implications for how rapidly children respond to feedback endorsing an entity or an incremental view. Regarding achievement motivation, 92% of the children who had received effort praise chose the learning goal after the first set of problems, by asking to receive additional problems that they would learn from. By comparison, just 8% of the children who had received the intelligence praise chose this option. The other 92% of the children who had received intelligence praise opted for problems that would be easy so they could look smart or do well. Among the children who had gotten no feedback, about half chose performance and half chose learning goals, in keeping with the baseline representation of entity and mastery theorists in the general U.S. population.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2609,"Children’s post-failure attributions after the second set of problems were also affected by the intervention. Those who had been praised for effort after the first problem set attributed their subsequent failure to diminished effort, whereas those who were praised for ability attributed their subsequent failure to lack of ability. Task enjoyment was also very much affected, with children who were praised for intelligence reporting less enjoyment of the task than children who were praised for effort. In terms of persistence, children praised for effort were more likely to want to take some additional problems home. Finally, performance on the third set of problems was also influenced by the intervention feedback after the first set. Children praised for effort did better on the third set of problems than they had on the first set, and children praised for intelligence performed worse. Children who had received no praise showed no change. Thus a single sentence of feedback attributing success to intelligence or effort was associated with a cascade of remarkably different reactions to a subsequent failure event. In five subsequent experiments, the researchers replicated and extended these basic findings. When people with an entity view of intelligence (enduring or induced by feedback) face failure, they attribute the failure to a fixed quality of the self. In the context of such an attribution, people avoid further challenge, instead seeking evidence that they are indeed smart. If brief experimenter feedback can have such a large impact on children, parent and teacher feedback, which continues over time and comes from people who are very important to a child, would be expected to have even more. As was discussed in chapter 5, even when teachers simply told children a test would show “how good you are in relation to other children your age,” children’s performance declined (Graham & Golan, 1991).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

The research suggests that how adults talk to children about their accomplishments has a host of important consequences.

An attitude that mistakes are valuable because we can learn from them is consistent with a mastery approach to learning and with an incremental theory of intelligence.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2613,"Not correcting children’s work was part of this incremental approach. Dr. Montessori held that children naturally correct their mistakes when they can perceive those mistakes, just as a baby corrects his or her own mistakes in learning to walk. A child learns through repetition of exercises where the mistakes are obvious, she claimed, not from an adult’s correcting his or her work. “What is meant by correcting exercise books? It means marking them from 0 to 10. How can a zero correct anyone’s defects?” (1967a, p. 245). Instead, Dr. Montessori counseled that correction comes from the child’s own observation of his mistakes in the outcome, and that the materials the child works with should make it obvious to the child when he has erred (see the discussion in chapter 5 on the Control of Error).",Montessori,Academic/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2614,"In this way the adult avoids passing judgment on the child and thus inadvertently promoting the performance goal of looking good for the adult. Having children find their own errors through the materials and work to master materials for their own sakes would be expected to lead to (or preserve) a mastery orientation in Montessori children. Dr. Montessori clearly valued intrinsic over performance reasons for one’s work: “If work comes from an inner source, it is much more intense and much more fruitful” (1989, p. 85). Whether Montessori children do have more of a mastery orientation toward schoolwork than do children in traditional school situations is a question for empirical study. Children in other nontraditional school systems clearly do (for example, Boaler, 1997; Boaler & Staples, 2003). Regardless, in counseling teachers never to give entity praise or criticism to children, Dr. Montessori’s recommendations for teachers are consistent with what self-theories research suggests will produce the most optimal child outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

In addition, when a child needs a break from work in Montessori, the child can take it. Children can stop and daydream for a time, pick up a recreational book, engage in free drawing, perhaps go outside and play, and so on. Of course, children are not free to abandon their education, and the teacher is responsible for noticing if a child is not using time wisely and intervening if needed.

excerpt_2619,"To the extent that children might interact with other children in traditional schooling arrangements, those others are usually of about the same age and ability. One might say that children are grouped in narrow bands. The first band is by age level: most of the children in the classroom are born within one year of each other, with a set birth date as the cut-off for being part of a classroom. Within each classroom, in many schools children are also grouped by ability level for each subject (“tracked”). By learning in this manner, children are removed from other children who are at very different levels. Their learning occurs in a narrow ability band. This is convenient to a factory model, since factories operate most efficiently if all of the raw materials are uniform. It suits the Lockean model of the child as well, since children at the same level are assumed to be alike and thus ready for the same knowledge to be poured in.",Traditional,Academic,Example,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2620,"To examine this, researchers exposed toddlers to either a female adult or a 3-year-boy performing a variety of actions (Ryalls, Gul, & Ryalls, 2000). While sitting on their mothers’ laps, the children observed the model performing action sequences such as inserting a ball into a plastic egg, closing the egg, and shaking it. To see if they imitated the model’s actions, children were given the objects immediately and again after a one-week delay. Regardless of the delay time, children who had seen a slightly older peer model replicated a greater number of complex action sequences than did children exposed to an adult model, suggesting the peer elicited more imitation. This is a fascinating finding in need of replication. Because only one model was used for each condition, it is possible that some other difference in the models besides their peer/adult status was responsible for the result. We know, for example, that people are particularly apt to imitate those with whom they have better rapport (Bernieri, 1988), and perhaps children felt more rapport with the child for reasons other than age. More research is needed on this issue, using several different peer and adult models, but the finding is intriguing.",Montessori,Academic,Study,excerpt,Learning from Peers,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2621,"Montessori encourages learning from peers in part by using three-year age groupings. This ensures that as children move through the classroom they will be exposed to older and younger peers, facilitating both imitative learning and peer tutoring (discussed later). Dr. Montessori was quite clear about the need for this mix of ages: “The main thing is that the groups should contain different ages. . . . To have success you must have these different ages. . . . The older children are interested in the younger, and the younger in the older” (Montessori, 1989, pp. 68–69). A child enters the Primary classroom at 21 ⁄2 or 3 years of age and remains there until he or she has completed the “cycle of materials,” the full set of materials Dr. Montessori determined was optimal for a Primary classroom.

excerpt_2628,"The construct of attachment was first discussed by the British ethnologist and psychoanalyst John Bowlby (1969) as an explanation for the failure of many babies to thrive in European orphanages following World War II--they lacked a close relationship with an adult. According to attachment theory, children need a close adult who will function as a secure base from which to explore the world and a safe haven to which to retreat in times of stress. The psychologist Mary Ainsworth (1967), Bowlby’s colleague, moved the attachment construct from the theoretical to the empirical realm by establishing a method to assess attachment. Her method has been very important to our understanding of child development because it allows us to make reliable long-term predictions of child outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2629,"The paradigm Ainsworth devised to measure attachment is called the Strange Situation. The infant, usually between 12 and 18 months of age (the test may not be valid outside of that age range), is brought into a room full of toys with his or her mother. Over the next 15 or 20 minutes, the mother and a stranger come and go in a series of prearranged episodes. At one point the child is alone with the toys, then the door opens and in walks not the mother but the stranger. This is often very upsetting to the child, who usually already appeared stressed over being left alone. A moment later the mother returns, and the behavior of the child during this reunion is particularly diagnostic for attachment classification.",Traditional,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

The most common pattern in American babies, termed secure attachment, is characterized by a child seeming unambiguously glad to see the mother and seeking and obtaining comfort from her. Approximately 70% of American babies respond in this way at 12 to 18 months, and they tend to develop most positively in the years to come.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2631,"Different patterns of child behavior characterize different attachment styles (Weinfield, Sroufe, Egeland, & Carlson, 1999) ... some babies appear to avoid the mother--they do not look her in the eye and seem determined to try to be independent.

excerpt_2632,"As stated, long-term outcome studies favor the secure attachment style. For example, in one study, children whose attachment status had been classified when they were infants returned to the laboratory at 2 years of age to engage in some problem-solving tasks with their mothers. Children previously rated as securely attached were more competent problem solvers, were more persistent, showed more enthusiasm, and were also more compliant with their mothers (Matas, Arend, & Sroufe, 1978).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

When children were told they were not doing well in the game, securely attached children upped their efforts, whereas insecurely attached children decreased their efforts.

The attachment Q-sort was developed to measure attachment security in the preschool and school years (Waters & Deane, 1985). For this measure, the child’s teacher or some other trained observer sorts preselected statements concerning a child’s possible profile into piles indicating whether the statements are more or less characteristic of the child. The statements are about such issues as how the child responds to fearful situations, the child’s predominant mood, and how often the child seeks proximity and comfort. Sort patterns are used to place children into the different attachment style categories, and these categories correspond closely with attachment classifications from the Strange Situation months or years earlier, and predict a similar range of developmental outcomes.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2637,"A measure used to assess attachment in adults is the Adult Attachment Interview, in which people are asked to describe their relationship with their parents (Bakermans-Kranenburg & Van Ijzendoorn, 1993; Hesse, 1999). Responses on this interview tend to be related to the interaction style of one’s current relationships (Treboux, Crowell, & Waters, 2004), to parenting behaviors (Adam, Gunnar, & Tanaka, 2004), and to one’s attachment classification as an infant. In one study, people who were tested in the Strange Situation as infants and as adults found that 72% of participants were classified with the convergent attachment styles at both time points (Waters, Merrick, Treboux, Crowell, & Albersheim, 2000). Thus, attachment is an enduring construct, applicable even beyond infancy.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2638,"Given the importance of the construct to predicting later competence and well-being, a pertinent question is what leads a child to have a particular type of relationship with the caregiver. Bowlby (1969) and Ainsworth (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) believed that an important antecedent factor in attachment style was adult sensitivity, and research has borne out that possibility (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Discussion following refers to maternal sensitivity because that was Ainsworth’s main concern, but the constructs seem to apply to any close caregiver. Important attachment relationships also of course develop with fathers (Grossmann et al., 2002), and they also appear to develop with day-care providers and teachers. Children growing up on Israeli kibbutzim become attached to their caregivers, and the quality of those relationships also predicts children’s outcomes (Oppenheim, Sagi, & Lamb, 1988). Children with a secure attachment to their kibbutz caregiver were later more goal directed and achievement oriented than were other children. This is consistent with work showing that American children’s relationships with their kindergarten teachers are related to their academic and behavioral outcomes through eighth grade (Hamre & Pianta, 2001).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2639,"Awareness requires that the mother be proximate to the infant so that she can perceive the infant’s signals. This aspect of attachment theory led to a concern beginning in the 1970s about whether babies placed in day care could become attached to their mothers. After many years of controversy, the recent National Study of Day Care, involving a representative sample of over 1,000 American children in a variety of day-care arrangements, has shown that use of day care has no significant impact on child-mother attachment relations (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). It is the mother’s awareness of signals when she is with the infant that appears to matter, and not that she is with the infant at all times. One might revise Ainsworth’s criteria for awareness, then, to read that the adult must be proximate to the infant for some reasonable amount of time, and when proximate, must be able to perceive the infant’s signals. A second aspect of awareness, besides proximity, is having a low perceiving threshold. The adult must notice the child’s signals.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2640,"The second major aspect of sensitivity for Ainsworth is accurate interpretation. Adults must interpret the babies’ signals for what they are, rather than distorting the signals in some way. Distortions could be caused by adults projecting their own needs on the infant, denying the infant’s needs because of their own needs, or any other biasing of the infant’s signals to accord with the adult’s own wishes and needs. Ainsworth noted that to overcome such proclivities, the adult must have self-insight. A second feature necessary to accurate interpretation, according to Ainsworth, is empathy. Adults who lack empathy, she said, would have detached, intellectual relations with babies instead of warm, sensitive ones. “A mother might be quite aware of and understand accurately the baby’s behavior and the circumstances leading to her baby’s distress or demands, but because she is unable to empathize with him -- unable to see things from the baby’s point to view--she may tease him back into good humor, mock him, laugh at him, or just ignore him” (Ainsworth, 1969, p. 2). Lack of empathy thus leads to inappropriate response.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2641,"Even correctly interpreted signals can be followed by inappropriate responses. The third main feature of sensitivity for Ainsworth is that the response to the perceived and accurately interpreted signal be an appropriate one. Ainsworth noted that in the first year, the appropriate response to the baby is almost always what the child “asks” for via his or her signals: pick the child up when the signal indicates a desire to be held, feed the child when the signal indicates hunger, and so on. After the first year, Ainsworth noted that doing exactly as the baby asks is no longer always the best response. As they get older, children increasingly need to adapt to the world, rather than always expecting the world to adapt to them. On the other hand, children also need to feel some sense of control or efficacy, as suggested by the research presented in chapter 3. Ainsworth advised that thebest response after age 1 is a compromise response that keeps the child’s long-range interests at heart.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2642,The final feature of sensitivity concerns timing of the response. Ainsworth noted that responses must be prompt to be effective. Adults who were devoted to a rigid feed or sleep schedule would be insensitive on this point. Responses need to be timed closely after the baby’s calls for attention for the baby to experience the efficacy of his or her actions.,Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2643,"Ainsworth’s theoretical ideas regarding sensitivity were compiled into a rating scale on which the sensitivity of primary caregivers to their children could be scored by trained observers watching mothers and children interact. Ainsworth’s original study of 23 mother-child pairs found a remarkably strong relationship between maternal sensitivity and child attachment classification (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Many studies have been done in the meantime, and the results are not as strong; some even fail to show a relationship. When results are inconsistent, the best response is a meta-analysis combining results across many studies. A recent meta-analysis of maternal sensitivity and attachment shows there is a relationship between the two factors, such that (in statistical terms) a child’s chances of being securely attached move from 38% if a mother is not sensitive to 62% if the mother is sensitive (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997). Because all scales and measures are prone to some degree of “measurement error,” the relationship in real terms might be stronger.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2644,"The issue of direction of effects naturally arises here. Perhaps the reason some mothers respond sensitively has to do with characteristics of the infant, and those infant characteristics lead to the later positive outcomes. In this view, the mother has no direct bearing on the child’s later outcomes. The obvious infant characteristic to consider is the child’s personality (or temperament), and studies have been done examining the relationship between child personality and attachment security (Vaughn & Bost, 1999). The upshot of these studies is that although personality predicts some aspects of behavior in the Strange Situation, it does not predict reunion behaviors, which are the most diagnostic of relationship quality.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2645,"One could still argue, however, that some aspect of the child is responsible for attachment classification. Experimental designs can address this. In fact, several intervention studies have been conducted, in which mothers were trained to respond more sensitively to their infants and changes in attachment classification following the intervention were examined. A recent meta-analysis of 88 intervention studies showed that short, focused interventions related to maternal sensitivity were effective both in making parents respond more sensitively to their infants and in changing infant attachment status (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van Ijzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). Such work strongly suggests that maternal sensitivity has a causal relationship to attachment classification.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2646,"Ainsworth’s rating scales were designed for observation of mothers with their infants. But a mother’s interaction style with a child evolves over time. Other research has looked at how parents of securely attached infants behave toward them somewhat later, as toddlers and preschoolers. One can view this as addressing how the sensitive pattern of responding adapts as children age. Mothers whose children were insecurely attached as infants tend to interact more intrusively with them in first and second grades (Egeland, Pianta, & O’Brien, 1993). Their interaction styles are more directive, such that they are more apt to tell their children exactly what to do. In contrast, parents of securely attached children tend not simply to tell the children what to do, but instead make suggestions, helping children to figure things out for themselves (Fagot, Gauvain, & Kavanagh, 1996; Frankel & Bates, 1990; Matas et al., 1978; Moss, 1992). They are closely involved, but nonintrusive. In Bruner’s (1975) terms, echoing Vygotsky, parents of securely attached children provide ideal scaffolds for children, structuring the environment such that children can internalize problem-solving strategies (see also Gauvain, 2001), whereas parents of insecurely attached children are more directive.

excerpt_2647,"Dr. Montessori advised that teachers show a degree of warmth and sensitivity that is reminiscent of the characteristics of parents whose children are securely attached. The focal period for forming attachment relationships (12 to 18 months) is of course usually prior to the age of entry into a Montessori classroom. Yet there is nothing to indicate that the adult behaviors associated with particular attachment styles cease to matter, and indeed those behaviors are consistent with literature suggesting optimal parenting practices for older children as well.

As is indicated in the quote above, Dr. Montessori maintained the teacher should serve as a safe haven whenever the child needs that. Yet when the child is ready to explore, the Montessori teacher was advised to be sensitive to the child’s need for increased independence, heeding the child’s call to “Help me to do it alone!” (Montessori, 1948/1976, p. 103).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Indeed, Dr. Montessori (1917/1965) said, “The fundamental quality [teachers must possess was] a capacity for observation” (p. 130). Like the sensitive parents described by Ainsworth (1969), teachers’ thresholds for perceiving signals should be low. They should be trained to notice and correctly interpret the behavioral manifestations of the child’s inner state, in order to know what to do next. As is discussed later in the chapter with regard to teacher training, Dr. Montessori also advised teachers to develop self-understanding, so they do not misinterpret children’s signals in ways that align with their own needs.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2650,"When children are concentrating on work, Dr. Montessori held that they should be left alone, because during such moments, she believed, they are developing themselves. In chapter 3, I discussed the idea that concentration might be an engine of self-regulation, which is associated with many positive personality variables. Dr. Montessori saw concentration as the moment of self-development. Because of this theoretical stance, she held that teachers must watch for any concentrated purposeful movement, so as to let it go undisturbed; the child must be protected from stimuli that would break the concentration. For example, Dr. Montessori described an incident in which a child who had thus far been disorderly in school one day began to rearrange the furniture, with an expression of intense interest. The teacher was inclined to stop him, but Dr. Montessori saw his activity as coordinated toward a useful end, and manifesting that child’s first moments of concentration on purposeful activity in the classroom. According to Dr. Montessori, a sensitive teacher would leave a child alone in such actions, as long as the child was not disturbing others.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2651,"The Montessori teacher must also be sensitive to when the child is ready for something new, because “the brain always asks for work which becomes more complex” (Montessori, 1989, p. 89). After great concentration a child may need to rest or simply observe others (Montessori, 1989, p. 19), but at a certain point the child will be ready for more complex work. The teacher must be attuned to such moments, and give the child new work when the child is ready. Further, like parents of securely attached children in problem-solving situations, the Montessori teacher must structure the environment in such a way that children can make discoveries on their own. Telling children, as traditional teaching often involves, is associated with insecure attachment relationships.",Montessori,Cognitive/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Efficiency was key, and the instructions as to how to run the classroom were provided by the school administrator. Behaviorist approaches, notably that of Thorndike, specified that the teacher’s role was to establish useful bonds in the child’s mind and eliminate useless and negative ones. Being businesslike was important in this approach as well; such concepts as “emotional warmth” do not figure prominently in behaviorist discourse; in the rare instances when Thorndike mentions emotional qualities for a teacher, it tends to be in a footnote (e.g., Thorndike, 1906/1962, p. 63). Thorndike’s recommendation for how a teacher should give instructions, for example, was to say, “Do the work on this page. Do it again, keeping track of how many minutes you spend. Practice again until you can get all the answers right in 12 minutes” (Thorndike, 1921b, p. 17). Communication was to be simple, direct, and dry.

In fact, Montessori’s decline from an initial period of great popularity in the United States around 1920 is often attributed to the writing of education professor William Kilpatrick (1914), who opposed Montessori’s introduction of reading and writing to children before they reach the age of 6 and is discussed further in chapter 10. Books at such an early age were deemed harmful by several of Montessori’s contemporaries. Montessori clearly has high academic and behavioral expectations of children, which Dr. Montessori would say are the result of children themselves indicating what they were capable of and drawn to when free within a specially prepared environment.",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

If children can imagine fairy tales, she wrote, why not ask them to imagine parts of the real earth that they cannot see? Children apparently surprised her repeatedly by showing interest in real activities over play, and she responded by creating an educational system that expects maturity, as do authoritative parents. This can put people off, because they see Montessori education as not being sufficiently fun. Empirical research should more directly address this issue, but the Middle School study mentioned previously (Rathunde & Csikszentmihalyi, in press) and other work concerning children’s motivation and affect when engaged in Montessori-like practices (collaborative learning, lack of extrinsic rewards, and so) in traditional settings suggest that it is probably not a concern. Children do appear to enjoy learning in the circumstances of Montessori classrooms.",Montessori,Academic/Behavioral,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2678,"As was discussed earlier, Dr. Montessori advised that adults show great emotional warmth when dealing with children. Children must have “a teacher who looks on them with love and hope” (Montessori, 1989, p. 79). Yet at the same time, the adult’s ultimate control of the environment was clearly a high priority. The pitfalls of permissive adult attitudes were pointed out in her writing. “If freedom is understood as letting the children do as they like, using or more likely misusing, the things available, it is clear that only their ‘deviations’ are free to develop” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 206). Permissive parents are often thought of as ones who want to be their children’s friends; it is hard for them to exercise authority. Dr. Montessori saw the dangers in this: “The teacher must be superior and not just a friend. . . . [Children] need a dignified, mature person. . . . If they have no authority, they have no directive. Children need this support” (1989, p. 17). Some Montessori teachers, like some parents, err in this regard. They do not provide ultimate control over the environment, deal effectively with unproductive behaviors, or guide children’s decisions in positive ways. Freedom can thus be taken to an extreme, and Dr. Montessori counseled against this repeatedly. “One time I saw an entire class of disorganized children who were using the materials completely wrongly. The teacher drifted about in the class, silent as the Sphinx. . . . This teacher was committing a grave error: She feared disturbing their disorder, instead of attempting to establish the order” (Montessori, 1956, p. 140).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2679,"Another not uncommon error in Montessori teaching is the opposite one: for teachers to be overly rigid about the method, in a manner reminiscent of authoritarian parents. Dr. Montessori also spoke against an authoritarian stance: “The teacher can address the pupil energetically and severely and thus jolt him out of his behavior, but those who know their jobs well have means more effective than coercion for recalling the pupil to order” (1956, p. 141). Authoritarian parents tell children to do things because the parent says so; they do not reason with the child, and they appear to take on a stance that they are infallible. Yet adults who work with children have to admit to being fallible (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246). Education, she said, was traditionally “directed toward the suppression or bending of the child’s will, and the substitution for it of the teacher’s will, which demands from the child unquestioning obedience” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 252). Against the behaviorist trend, she said, “We cannot directly mold. . . . individual forms of character, intelligence, and feeling” (1917/1965, p. 9).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

They should provide an appropriately structured environment in which children are free to make their own decisions and discoveries. They should intervene only when children’s behavior is not constructive. They should have high expectations and give reasons, all with warm love.",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

Still, my guess is that a new class of children in the same school would not strongly affect a teacher’s responses and that teachers were the main causal factor in children’s responses. In addition, in chapter 3 I mentioned a study in which teachers were trained to give children more control in the classroom, and positive changes were observed in their students (De Charms, 1976).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,
excerpt_2682,"The study of teacher responses and child outcomes mentioned earlier in this section was replicated in Russia and revealed the same basic pattern of results. Unfortunately, as children get older in traditional American schools, the schools increasingly take away, rather than increase, children’s autonomy.

excerpt_2683,"The current swing toward external testing standards promotes the opposite behaviors in teachers. In one study, when teachers were told their students would have to pass specific educational standards, teachers became more controlling, talked and commanded more, gave students less choice and autonomy, and expressed more criticism of students (Deci, Spiefel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kaufman, 1982). Both as children get older, and when standardized testing is emphasized, teachers in traditional schools become more prone to create classroom environments that are at odds with more optimal child outcomes. In the context of traditional education, teachers can attempt to overcome the negative effects of grades and testing, and the inherently competitive, comparative system they create. The system, however, was designed for their use, and as the current enthusiasm for high-stakes testing shows, as a culture we keep returning to it.

First, as was discussed with reference to authoritative parenting, Montessori teachers’ expectations are high.

The Montessori teacher’s goal is clearly the child’s self-regulation; the teacher’s task was well done when the teacher was needed only to give additional lessons. “Any pedagogical action, if it is to be efficacious in the training of little children, must tend to help the children to advance upon this road of independence” (Montessori, 1912/1964, p. 97).

Before concentration occurs, the directress may do more or less what she thinks best; she may interfere with the children’s activities as much as she thinks necessary” (1967a, p. 278).

She recommended doing so by redirection rather than punishment. “Interfere by all means to stop disturbances, but we need not punish or scold or admonish when we stop bad behavior; we can ask the child to come and pick flowers in the garden or offer a toy or any occupation that will appeal to [the child]” (Montessori, 1989, p. 16).",Montessori,Behavioral/Social,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

When a child comes to an adult seeking praise, she said, then the child needs praise as assurance that he or she is on the right track (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 88).

excerpt_2697,"An ability to observe children and detect their needs is fundamental to good Montessori teaching. Dr. Montessori maintained that the capacity to observe children has to be carefully developed through long practice (1917/1965, p. 130). In the AMI Montessori teacher training courses, scores of hours are spent with children, observing their actions, recording those observations, and crafting them into reports to be reviewed by the teacher trainer. Dr. Montessori advocated training in science, rather than in education, for people who would go into Montessori teaching, in part because training in science is training in close observation (Montessori, 1917/1965, p. 138). She was also concerned that training in traditional education might make it more difficult to become a good Montessori teacher. “An ordinary teacher cannot be transformed into a Montessori teacher, but must be created anew, having rid herself of pedagogical prejudices” (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 87).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Example,excerpt,Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes,excerpt_dataset,

This is reminiscent of Ainsworth’s discussion of sensitivity, in which the sensitive mother is free from distortions caused by her own needs and desires, a state that aids her in seeing the child’s signals for what they are. This emphasis on one’s personal preparation to be a teacher contrasts sharply with traditional teacher training, which focuses more on how one does things than on one’s own psychology.

Lectures and practicums enable trainees to learn about the materials and the variety of ways in which they can be used to stimulate interest and use, as well as the interconnections between materials across the curriculum.

The knowledge in these albums is of course not as deep and thorough as that of the teacher trainer, just as the notes of a student taking a college course would not reflect all the knowledge of the professor, but they are sufficiently thorough to allow the teacher to refer to them over the coming years, and to guide his or her lessons in the future. Some other Montessori teacher training courses routinely give teachers copies of the information rather than having them write and illustrate it themselves.

His principles specified that in order to maximize efficiency, worker tasks had to be analyzed, planned, and controlled in detail by the factory manager. In the case of schools, the factory manager was the administrator. The workers, in this case the teachers, were to do as they were told. 2 Taylor management “was given national recognition at the 1913 convention of the Department of Superintendence when the main topic for discussion was ‘Improving School Systems by Scientific Management.’ There were scores of articles, books, and reports during the next decade on economy in education, efficiency in education, standardization in education, and the like” (Callahan, 1962, p. 23).",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,15

Once the trained teachers arrived on the job, administrators were to tell teachers exactly how and what to teach. “The worker must be kept supplied with detailed instructions as to the work to be done, the standards to be reached, the methods to be employed, and the appliances to be used” (Bobbit, 1913, as cited in Callahan, 1962, pp. 89–90).

The teacher is responsible for timing the lesson to match the bells. Every classroom of children is different, but preestablished schedules restrict the possibility of children’s needs guiding the lessons and their timing. Another drawback is that children can rarely pursue individual interests and activities, but instead have to follow the program that all the children follow, which is predetermined by the teacher or administrator.

Thorndike found that training on rectangles did not lead to improved performance on all of the polygons, but only on the rectangles. From this he inferred a general principle that human learning does not transfer to different situations, and he concluded that one could and should therefore educate children merely by strengthening bonds for the very information they needed to know, stripped of context.

However, although constructivism is taught in education courses today, research suggests that teachers have difficulty implementing the constructivist approach in American schools. As a result, the approach has had waves of popularity followed by retreat (Zilversmit, 1993). John Dewey, America’s most famous progressive educator, lamented near the end of his life that he had not made any real impact on schooling (Dworkin, 1959). Given that constructivism is a better model for learning, there must be strong reasons for its failure to penetrate schooling.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,31

He noted that retreats from constructivism have come at times of social and economic upheaval, such as the Great Depression and McCarthyism. At such times experimentation falls away in many domains as people opt for the comfort of familiarity.

If the teacher has a desk in front of a blackboard at the front of the classroom and students are seated in rows facing the teacher, small group or individual work is unnatural. The physical format is designed for lecturing. Although elementary teachers in particular increasingly allow children to sit in clusters instead of rows, other physical learning structures still gear them toward the model of an empty vessel. Learning in traditional schools comes largely from books, even during years when children in traditional schools are not yet particularly good readers. Because of this, teachers must tell children the information that is in the books in order for children to learn.

Beyond the physical artifacts reinforcing the Lockean model are the collective memories of teachers and parents. When considering children and how to treat them, there is a strong tendency to revert to one’s own childhood. Finally, behaviorist methods appear to work in the short run.

Yet people learn best when they are actively engaged. Good teachers try to keep children active by asking lots of questions during lectures, but the physical structure of the classroom is designed for passivity: the child sits and listens to the teacher, who stands at the blackboard and delivers knowledge. There is no need to consider the child’s interests in the prevailing model because empty vessels have nothing in them from which interests could stem. When interests do arise, since all vessels have been filled with the same stuff, all vessels should share interests.

Some people will read the chapters to come and respond that their own children’s schools are incorporating evidence-based changes, making them more like Montessori schools — eliminating grades, combining ages, using a lot of group work, and so on. One could take the view that over the years, traditional schooling has gradually been discovering and incorporating many of the principles that Dr. Montessori discovered in the first half of the 20th century. However, although schooling is changing, those changes are often relatively superficial. A professor of education might develop a new reading or math program that is then adopted with great fanfare by a few school systems, but the curricular change is minute relative to the entire curriculum, and the Lockean model of the child and the factory structure of the school environment still underlie most of the child’s school day and year. “Adding new ‘techniques’ to the classroom does not lead to the developmental of a coherent philosophy. For example, adding the technique of having children work in ‘co-operative learning’ teams is quite different than a system in which collaboration is inherent in the structure” (Rogoff, Turkanis, & Bartlett, 2001, p. 13). Although small changes are made reflecting newer research on how children learn, particularly in good neighborhood elementary schools, most of the time, in most American schools, traditional structures predominate (Hiebert, 1999; Stigler, Gallimore, & Hiebert, 2000), and observers rate the majority of classes to be low in quality (Weiss, Pasley, Smith, Banilower, & Heck, 2003).

After her medical training she worked in psychiatric clinics, where she became interested in helping mentally retarded children. At the beginning of the 20th century, mentally retarded people were often institutionalized in bare rooms, their food thrown at them. Dr. Montessori saw in their grasping at crumbs of food on the floor as starvation not for food, but for stimulation. She studied the methods of Jean-Marc Itard, who had worked with the Wild Boy of Aveyron, and his student Eduard Seguin seeking methods of providing such stimulation. Seguin had developed a set of sensory stimuli for the education of retarded children, and Dr. Montessori adopted these in her work, creating what in Montessori terminology are called the Sensorial Materials.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,44

Rather than marveling at what the mentally retarded children had done, she instead marveled at the fact that normal children were not doing better on such tests, given their obvious advantages. Then, as the famous Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1970) described it, “generalizing her discoveries with unparalleled mastery, Mme Montessori . . . immediately applied to normal children what she had learned from backward ones: during its earliest stages the child learns more by action than through thought [, leading her to develop] a general method whose repercussions throughout the entire world have been incalculable” (pp. 147–48).

As she developed new ideas, Montessori requested permission to apply them in public elementary schools, but the governing bodies in Rome at the time would not give her access to those children. In retrospect this limitation was probably providential, because the system she eventually developed for older, Elementary school children was based on children who had been in her Primary programs from ages 3 to 6. These children had at the outset a different set of skills and knowledge relative to other 6-year-olds, and the Elementary program could thus be built for children who were already reading and writing, who knew how to follow procedures and to make their own decisions about what to do next, and who understood some basic principles about how to get along as individuals in a large group.",Traditional,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,46

The cylinders in one set vary systematically in width while height remains the same, those in another vary in height while the width remains the same, and those in a third change by both height and width together. The fourth decreases in width and increases in height. The exercise of lifting the cylinders out, mixing them up, and then returning them to their appropriate holes was designed primarily to educate the child’s intelligence by engaging the child in an activity requiring that he or she observe, compare, reason, and decide (Montessori, 1914/1965).

Eleventhgraders’ vocabulary, reading comprehension, and general knowledge were all strongly predicted by their reading ability 10 years earlier, when they were in first grade, even when cognitive ability was controlled for (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997). Preschoolers who were trained in phonemic awareness scored significantly higher on tests of reading comprehension three years later, relative to children in a matched control condition (Byrne & Fielding-Barnsley, 1995). Research has also shown (not surprisingly) that the more one reads, the more one knows, controlling for intelligence and for years of education (Stanovich & Cunningham, 1993). Long-range reading skills are best predicted by a young child’s degree of interest in reading (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). Obviously, making reading unpleasant early on by putting children through a difficult and laborious process would not instill enjoyment of reading, and enjoyment of reading is characteristic of those who read a lot. Unlike the laborious process most first-graders go through, learning to read and write in Montessori appears to be a painless process for children. The organized approach Dr. Montessori took to the learning process would seem to be part of why it seems easy. She performed task analyses of different areas, and the Montessori curriculum presents the child with a series of manageable steps in each area aimed at mastering each task. The steps, derived from observations of children, are carefully organized, focus on important skills and information, and culminate in the child’s mastery. Moving to a larger scale, these observations led to a method of schooling with a different model of the child and the school than those that prevail in traditional schooling.",Traditional,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,69

He apparently attended at least one Montessori conference, in Rome in 1934, and was president of the Swiss Montessori Society. Letterhead from the early days of the Association Montessori Internationale lists Piaget as one of its sponsors (Kramer, 1976).

They get lessons across the curriculum, which bears some similarity to researchers going to colloquia or conferences to learn about new areas or techniques. The children talk with and collaborate with colleagues of their choosing. They pass on the fruits of their labors to others by giving talks to the class or other classes in their school and writing up papers.

However, to develop a system from a principle is very different than to insert a principle into a system that was designed with something else in mind. The eight principles I discuss emerged in the early days of Montessori education, through Dr. Montessori’s observations of children’s behavior in classrooms that were unusual to begin with.

cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p74,"1. Movement and Cognition: The first principle is that movement and cognition are closely entwined. This observation makes sense: our brains evolved in a world in which we move and do, not a world in which we sit at desks and consider abstractions. Dr. Montessori noted that thinking seems to be expressed by the hands before it can be put into words, an idea with which Piaget apparently concurred (Ginsburg & Oper, 1979). In small children, she said, thinking and moving are the same process. Piaget restricted this identity claim to the sensorimotor period, but, consistent with recent work in psychology, Dr. Montessori saw at least a close relationship between the two processes continuing past age 2. Based on this insight she developed a method of education in which a great deal of object manipulation occurs. In recent years there has been an explosion of fascinating research on the connection between movement and cognition that speaks to Dr. Montessori’s ideas about movement’s importance to thought. The findings imply that education should involve movement to enhance learning.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,74
cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p75,"2. Choice: A second principle is free choice. Dr. Montessori noted that children seemed to thrive on having choice and control in their environment, and she envisioned development as a process of the child’s being increasingly able to be independent in his or her environment. Although good Montessori programs impose definite limits on this freedom, Montessori children are free to make many more decisions than are children in traditional classrooms: what to work on, how long to work on it, with whom to work on it, and so on. Research in psychology suggests that more freedom and choice (within a carefully designed, ordered structure; see below) are linked to better psychological and learning outcomes, as shown in chapter 3.",Traditional,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,75
cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p76,"3. Interest: A third principle is that the best learning occurs in contexts of interest. Interest can be more personal, as when an individual has an abiding interest in ladybugs or dogs that seems to come from within, or it can be situational, an interest that would be engendered in many people exposed to such events and activities. Dr. Montessori created situational interest in part by designing materials with which children seemed to want to interact. She also trained Montessori teachers to give lessons in a manner that would inspire children, for example by presenting just enough information to pique curiosity and by using drama in their presentations (particularly with Elementary-aged children). Montessori education also capitalizes on interests that appear regularly at particular times in development, such as the intense interest children have in learning language in the preschool years. Dr. Montessori noted that young children seem to be driven to acquire word labels for the objects in their environment, so in the Primary classrooms, children are given a great deal of vocabulary. Montessori education also capitalizes on unique individual interest. Children pursue learning that is of personal interest to them—not in a manner that excludes large swaths of curriculum, but in a manner consistent with how we know the very best learning takes place. Rather than memorize facts chosen by a faraway state legislative body, children in Montessori Elementary schools write and present reports on what fascinates them, tying it into the foundational curriculum. The Montessori materials and basic lessons ensure a core of learning across curriculum areas, but each child’s imagination is invested in the particular avenues of learning that the child pursues beyond that core.",Montessori,,Material,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,76

Extrinsic Rewards Are Avoided: Dr. Montessori saw extrinsic rewards, such as gold stars and grades, to be disruptive to a child’s concentration. Sustained, intense periods of concentration are central to Montessori education. Dr. Montessori recounts children repeating problems (such as getting the Wooden Cylinders into their proper holes) dozens of times in succession, displaying a level of concentration that she herself had previously thought young children were incapable of. At the Primary level, children might concentrate intensely for 30 minutes at a time. By the Elementary level, they might work on the creation of a single chart for much of the day or even several days in succession. The rewards in Montessori education are internal ones. A good deal of research suggests that interest in an already-loved activity, such as learning seems to be for most children, is best sustained when extrinsic rewards are not part of the framework, as discussed in chapter 5.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,77
cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p78,"5. Learning with and from Peers In traditional schooling, the teacher gives the children information, and children rarely learn from each other or directly from materials (except texts, which often tell children rather than helping them discover). Although on the increase, working together is still rare in (traditional) elementary classrooms, where tests, problem sets, and papers are usually if not always done alone. In traditional preschool classrooms, in contrast, children usually play in groups. Montessori education is opposite in these arrangements, and is actually more in line with what developmentalists know about children: younger children are more apt to play side by side but not necessarily together, whereas elementary-age children are intensely social. In Montessori Primary classrooms, children may often work alone by choice, but in Elementary classrooms children are rarely seen working alone. They pursue knowledge in self-formed groups, creating products ranging from reports to dioramas, charts to plays, and timelines to musical scores. They leave the classroom together in small self-created groups to interview people outside of the school, or to visit museums or businesses that are relevant to a current project stemming from their own interests. Asked what happens in these small learning groups when one child understands better than the others—a concern that arises out of the individualistic traditional model in which one child might do most of the work — I recently heard a 9-year-old Montessori child respond, “We help each other.” Chapter 6 discusses research on what happens when students work together to learn, rather than working as individual units striving for the highest grades.",Traditional,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,78
cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p79,"6. Learning in Context: In traditional schooling, children sometimes learn without understanding how their learning applies to anything besides school tests. Dr. Montessori reacted to this by creating a set of materials and a system of learning in which the application and meaning of what one was learning should come across to every child. Rather than learning largely from what teachers and texts say to them, children in Montessori programs learn largely by doing. Because they are doing things, rather than merely hearing and writing, their learning is situated in the context of actions and objects. For example, as described earlier, children go out of the Elementary classroom and into the world to research their interests. A small group of children who have become interested in bridges, for example, may choose to locate a local engineer who will meet with them to explain how bridges are designed. This approach, sometimes referred to as “situated cognition,” reflects a movement in education that goes alongside current interests in cultural psychology, apprenticeship, and how people learn through participating in their culture. Evidence concerning the validity of this approach is reviewed in chapter 7.",Traditional,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,79
cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p80,"7. Teacher Ways and Child Ways: Dr. Montessori’s recommendations on how teachers should interact with children anticipated later research on parenting and teaching. When adults provide clear limits but set children free within those boundaries, and sensitively respond to children’s needs while maintaining high expectations, children show high levels of maturity, achievement, empathy, and other desirable characteristics. Traditional schools have sometimes erred by being too authoritarian, conveying a “do it because we said so” attitude that is not associated with positive child outcomes. When progressive schools fail, it may sometimes be because they trade the authoritarian teacher-centered features of many traditional schools for their opposite: permissive, overly child-centered ones. As described in chapter 8, Dr. Montessori prescribed a third style, one consistent with what is called authoritative parenting and known to be associated with the most optimal child outcomes. Her advice to teachers is reminiscent of the adult styles associated with positive child outcomes in other domains as well. This research is reviewed in chapter 8, “Adult Interaction Styles and Child Outcomes.”",Traditional,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,80

Order in Environment and Mind: Montessori classrooms are very organized, both physically (in terms of layout) and conceptually (in terms of how the use of materials progresses). This organization sometimes turns people off: it seems finicky, even obsessivecompulsive. Yet research in psychology suggests that order is very helpful to learning and development, and that Dr. Montessori was right on target in creating very ordered environments in schools. Children do not fare as well in less ordered environments. Chapter 9 reviews research on order and its impact on children.

cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p82,"Further Montessori Insights: Dr. Montessori also forecast other current ideas in developmental psychology not reviewed here. For example, she drew extensively on the idea of sensitive periods, which she credited to Hugo de Vries, the Dutch horticulturist best known for rediscovering Mendelian inheritance. Developmental scientists consider sensitive periods to be times when an organism is particularly primed to develop in certain ways, given certain environmental stimulations. It was many years later that Konrad Lorenz popularized this notion with strong evidence of such periods in goslings, and ethological theory began to be incorporated into theories of human development. Among other sensitive periods, Dr. Montessori identified the first five years as a sensitive period for language in children. She went so far as to claim the innateness of human language (Montessori, 1967a) years before Noam Chomsky (1959) rocked the world of psycholinguistics with that same claim. She talked repeatedly of how important early experience is to development (Montessori, 1967a), well before research in neuroscience backed that idea (Bransford et al., 1999). She also considered development to continue all the way to age 24, about the age when neuroscientists now believe neurological development is complete (Gogtay et al., 2004). In these and other ways Dr. Montessori was clearly well ahead of her time. A natural question at this point is whether the educational system she developed incorporating such insights has outcomes that are superior to those of traditional schools.",Traditional,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 01),cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,82

Good research on the effectiveness of different school programs is actually very difficult to do (Mervis, 2004). One common shortcoming is lack of random assignment: parents choose to send their children to Montessori programs. Features of parenting tend to swamp features of schools when it comes to education outcomes. Parents who happen to like Montessori programs might be, by and large, excellent parents: they like order, they like children to be able to make choices, and so on. Such parents would incorporate those features into the child’s home life, and the additive benefit of having those features in school might be nil.

In such cases, one cannot tease apart individual teacher effects from program effects. Perhaps the one or two Montessori schoolteachers whose classrooms were sampled in one study were superb teachers, and in another study the Montessori teachers were poor ones. Respectively positive and negative findings would result, with an effect of teacher quality misattributed to an effect of program.

There is no litmus test for calling a school a Montessori school. Even if one uses an accredited school, the different Montessori organizations have very different accreditation criteria, with some adhering more closely to Dr. Montessori’s methods than others. Researchers often have not known how to determine whether a program adheres sufficiently to the principles and curriculum to be considered a good example of Montessori, and instead they tend to trust that if a school calls itself Montessori, then it is a good place to test whether Montessori education matters for outcomes. In this book, I describe Montessori education as conveyed in Dr. Montessori’s writings and in the training courses of the Association Montessori Internationale.

cleaned_ch01-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p87,"There are a few suggestive studies that get around one or more of these problems. Two Great Society–era studies used random assignment into different Head Start Programs and looked at long-term outcomes (Karnes, Shewedel, & Williams, 1983; Miller & Dyer, 1975; Miller & Bizzell, 1983, 1984). In both studies, the implementation of Montessori was mediocre in all of the classrooms involved, the number of teachers involved was small, and by the end of the longitudinal study period many children had been “lost,” so the sample sizes were small (although still representative of the original sample). With these limitations in mind, in both studies, with children randomly assigned to less than a year of mediocre-quality Montessori at age 4, some positive outcomes were obtained for Montessori children relative to children in other types of preschool Head Start programs and these advantages lasted as far out as high school, when the studies terminated. For example, in the Karnes (Illinois) study, fewer Montessori children dropped out of school or were retained a grade. In the Miller (Kentucky) study, the Montessori boys (in particular) had higher standardized test scores than the children from the comparison Head Start programs (such as traditional preschool, Bereiter-Engleman, and Darcy).

Although subject to the state requirements imposed on all public schools (perhaps use of particular tests and workbooks, for example), the schools involved attained “associated” status with AMI, the accrediting organization that Dr. Montessori started to oversee quality in Montessori schools. In addition, the children had an extended Montessori treatment, from ages 3 to 11, as opposed to less than one year in the work already mentioned. On the negative side, the sample was not randomly assigned. Although the public Montessori school children were admitted by lottery, the lottery losers were not tracked and so were unavailable as a comparison group. This self-selection is problematic. In an attempt to redress this, the group of children with whom the Montessori children were compared was a particularly challenging one with which to find difference: fellow students at their current high schools, who were matched for gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Over half the 201 Montessori students in the study were placed in Milwaukee’s top four high schools.

Even when selfinstigated locomotion is delayed, even when it never occurs (as with paraplegic babies), basic psychological developments still occur in humans. Nonetheless, Dr. Montessori was exactly right in her insight that development and movement are closely entwined.

Ten pairs of kittens, one a leader and one a follower, were reared in the dark except for three hours each day, when they were placed in a normally lit room. While in this room, the leader kitten had attached to its body a harness and cart that pulled the follower kitten around. This set-up allowed the leader to actively explore the environment, guided by vision, while the follower kitten was passively pulled through the same environment. Although the follower had the same visual experience of moving through the environment, it was not actively engaged in the exploration. After three months, the kittens’ vision was tested, and the findings suggested that active movement guided by one’s vision was crucial to normal visual development. Whereas the leader kittens responded to such events as looming objects and apparent drop-offs, the follower kittens did not show evidence of perceiving depth.

First, infants who more actively explore the environment with their hands are also advanced in their ability to perceive object boundaries, noting where one object ends and another begins (Needham, 2000). We know this because infants at 3 and 4 months who were more actively engaged with teething toys during a pretest phase were more likely to show surprise when two objects moved together than when they moved separately, whereas less active object explorers showed the opposite pattern. This suggests that interacting with objects may confer important knowledge of the physical world and how objects should behave. Several researchers have noted that once infants begin to reach for objects, they show increased interest in the world of objects (Fogel, Dedo, & McEwen, 1992), and such interest could be the basis of the later knowledge (see chapter 4).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 02),cleaned_ch02-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,11

When the monkeys are given a tool (a rake) that enlarges reachable space, those same neurons fire to objects farther away (Iriki, Tanaka, & Iwamura, 1996). Recent research has shown the same process on a cognitive level for the perception of space in human adults: when adults are given a tool that will reach more distant objects, they judge those objects to be objectively closer than when they lack such a tool (Witt, Proffitt, & Epstein, 2004).

Infants of just 3.5 months of age were given early experiences getting objects via Velcro mittens that enabled them to pick up objects before their manual coordination was sufficient to do so. The results were striking. Infants who had had 10–12 brief play sessions with Velcro mittens later showed far more visual attention to new objects, a much greater propensity to reach for those objects, and even a greater tendency to mouth new objects than did other infants of the same age (Needham, Barrett, & Peterman, 2002).

Some studies of self-locomotion and gaze following occurred in China (Tao & Dong, 1997, described in Campos et al., 2000). At least at the time of this study, urban Chinese infants spent much of their awake time propped in a sitting position on a very soft bed, surrounded by thick pillows to prevent falling. Their parents discouraged crawling to prevent dirty hands, and the infants crawled late relative to suburban Chinese infants who were more often permitted to crawl. When tested in a gaze-following procedure, suburban Chinese infants followed about 75% of gazes, whereas urban ones followed only about 50%.

Surely people must have also seen the entertainment value of such toys, but concern with their use in guiding development was not common at the time. The field of child study, in fact, was in its infancy. More recently, discoveries concerning the impact of “enriched” environments on the brains of laboratory rats has led to Americans filling cribs with all kinds of objects for exploration, but Dr. Montessori advised giving young children only a limited choice of carefully selected objects (see chapter 3).",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 02),cleaned_ch02-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,24

These are intended to encourage babies to move their hands and their whole bodies.

In fact, Dr. Montessori recommended that a baby’s toys be placed at a slight distance away at first, in order to encourage the baby to move a short distance to them. As the baby becomes more competent at moving (even prior to crawling) the toys are moved farther away, again to encourage movement. An interesting issue for further research is the Montessori claim that even prior to crawling, babies who sleep on floor beds push themselves about with their legs much more so than do crib babies, and that, once crawling, they crawl more because they are inspired to get objects they can see at a distance.

In another study, at 6 months stomach sleepers were more advanced in their social development and communication relative to back sleepers. In absolute terms, these differences were still apparent at 18 months, but statistically they were no longer significant (Dewey, Fleming, & Golding, 1998). However, one problem dampening the results of this study was that mothers were asked about sleep position only once, at 4 weeks, and it is likely that sleep position changed later. Since parents tend to relax with time, and (at least anecdotally) many babies sleep better on their stomachs, it is likely that a proportion of babies who were sleeping on their stomachs by 3 or 4 months were still classified in the “back sleepers” group.

Such light furniture would also allow them to learn to control their own movements: if one bumps a light table, the table moves.

This subtle difference, one might speculate, could in part result from such factors as opportunities for movement in infancy. Unlike American babies, who, until recently, usually slept on their stomachs, Asian babies have traditionally slept on their backs, so chances are the Americans in these studies were prone sleepers as infants and the Asians were supine sleepers. The prone position leads to earlier crawling and might be one among many cultural practices that subtly influence a focus on agency and the American tendency to locate agents in scenes.

In addition to providing meaning for actions, Practical Life activities lead children to practice concentration, a hallmark of Montessori education.

Dr. Montessori called the peace that she saw to be achieved through concentration “normalization,” because she observed that most of children’s troublesome behaviors disappeared when they experienced concentration on meaningful activities.

In contrast, only 1 of the 26 infants had this level of success when they were carried to the hiding location.

When an object is both a symbol and something to play with, children have trouble seeing it as a symbol (DeLoache, 2000). For example, if young children are allowed to play with a dollhouse that is also a model for a larger space, they have more trouble using the dollhouse as a symbol for the larger space than they do when they do not play with it.

Teachers in origin classrooms are like “authoritative” parents: they are warm and accepting, but provide clear and consistent rules, and insist children go by them (see chapter 8). In contrast, teachers in pawn classrooms are controlling and directive, employing a style called “authoritarian.” De Charms’s research showed that children tend to be internally motivated and have a greater sense of personal responsibility in origin classrooms, and that they are more externally motivated in pawn classrooms (De Charms, 1976). One might wonder if the children were driving the teacher styles to begin with. However, when teachers in pawn classrooms were instructed on how to change the classroom orientation, changes in the children ensued.

However, in this study, since the questionnaires assessing classroom environment and well-being measures were administered together, it is possible that children filled them out with the same valence: “I am more powerful, I am better and more motivated.” It was therefore advisable to confirm the findings using different instruments and allowing a time lapse between assessments. To do this, the researchers returned to the school two months later and gave a common psychology test called a Thematic Apperception Task (TAT). For this task, the children were shown a picture of a child in a traditional classroom situation and were asked to write a story about the picture.

In traditional schools of the day, small children sat on benches that were too high, so their legs dangled. Furthermore, the furniture was usually bolted to the ground. Making movable furniture the proper size for children, rather than having children sit in adult-sized furniture, was apparently a Montessori innovation (Elkind, 1976). As Dr. Montessori described it: ""The principal modification in the matter of school furnishings is the abolition of desks, and benches or stationary chairs. I have had tables made with wide, solid, octagonal legs, spreading in such a way that the tables are at the same time solidly firm and very light, so light, indeed, that two four-year-old children can easily carry them about. I also designed and had manufactured little chairs. . . . We permit the child to select the position which he finds most comfortable. He can make himself comfortable as well as seat himself in his own place. And this freedom is not only an external sign of liberty, but a means of education.

For this reason the only expenditure permitted was such as would have been required by an office for furniture and equipment. That is why she had tables made for these small children, with chairs to match, instead of school desks which were universally in use at that time.

One study demonstrated this in a fancy grocery store setting in which a display was set up offering special jams. When a very large selection (24 or more) of sample jams was available to try, people were less likely to purchase a jam than when only 6 sample jams were available. When they did purchase jam, people selecting from fewer options were more satisfied with their choices (Iyengar & Lepper, 2000). A replication showed this same phenomenon with gourmet chocolates. In fact, people who had to choose one among many chocolates later preferred to take money rather than additional chocolates as a reward; people choosing from among 6 types opted for more chocolate. A third experiment offered students the opportunity to write essays for extra credit in a college course, which allowed the experimenters to examine the effect of limited choice on performance as well.

The simple answer is that their freedom is restricted: they might be asked to stay right by the teacher, perhaps for the entire morning or day, so she can by her presence help the child to control himself or herself. Research suggests that fewer children would misbehave in Montessori classrooms than in traditional ones, however. First, as described earlier, children in origin classrooms see others as less aggressive, which could translate to their own behavior. Second, as will be discussed later, training in attention appears to reduce aggressive behavior. Because they can make their own choices among interesting work, and because of the prevalence of concentration, children may be less apt to misbehave in Montessori classrooms than in traditional ones.

Every day, once a child has checked off a work of each type, then the child is free to choose any work he or she likes. Although such an implementation might sound good on the surface, research reported in chapter 5 on rewards shows a serious problem with implementations involving checking off work in order to get to other work: when one activity is posed as a means to an end, that activity is devalued relative to when it is simply presented on its own (Lepper, Sagotsky, Dafoe, & Greene, 1982). The result of such systems can be devaluation of the very work that was considered most important. There might well also be costs in terms of attention and concentration, discussed later in this chapter. Children who are told they must check off some work in order to get to other work might engage in initial work superficially, without deep concentration. With the Work Journals, in which Elementary children simply record what they have done each minute of the day, the child has a greater sense of choice and freedom.

To pay attention is to regulate one’s behavior. Children who are better at self-regulating show more positive social behavior on a variety of measures. For example, one study obtained teacher ratings of 82 preschool children on four dimensions of self-regulation, each consisting of multiple items: focused attention (items such as “When drawing or coloring in a book, shows strong concentration”), attention shifting (“Can move on to a new task when asked”), inhibitory control (“Can lower his/her voice when asked to do so”), and impulsivity (“Sometimes interrupts others when they are speaking,” an item that is “reverse-scored”) (Cumberland-Li, Eisenberg, & Rieser, 2004). Parents’ ratings were also obtained on these measures for about half of the sample. In addition, children nominated three classmates who were nice, three who were cooperative, and so on, and these nominations were summed to give each child an agreeableness rating. Teachers also gave agreeableness ratings of children, via a 20-item scale stating how descriptive of a child each item was (such as “cooperative,” “warm,” and “generous”).",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 03),cleaned_ch03-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,86

Children’s ratings of other children’s agreeableness were also fairly well related to teacher ratings of those children’s abilities to control their attention, and they were even more strongly related to parents’ ratings of those children’s ability to focus attention and control impulses. Thus, although some halo effects might have been operating, the results present a consistent picture whereby preschoolers who are higher in self-regulation are also seen by others as being warmer, more cooperative, and so on.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 03),cleaned_ch03-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,87

Even for adults, the ability to regulate one’s own behavior is related to agreeableness as well as conscientiousness (Jensen-Campell et al., 2002). Interesting comparative research has shown that in monkeys, attention training appears to reduce aggression and improve self-regulation even outside of the training contexts.2 Nonhuman primates raised in captivity can be notoriously difficult and are described as natural models for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

However, the tasks incorporated in these programs are not at all like the tasks on computer programs typically aimed at children. The tasks on many popular software packages for children might be described as “bells and whistles” tasks: they pull children in and regulate their attention for them, much as television programs do. An increasing body of research is pointing to possible links between television watching and the incidence of ADHD. One recent study showed that the more hours children watched television each day at ages 1 and 3, the higher the likelihood they would be diagnosed with ADHD at age 7 (Christakis, Zimmerman, DiGiuseppe, & McCarty, 2004). Other studies have shown concurrent relations between attention problems and television watching among preschoolers and elementary school children (Levine & Waite, 2000; Ozmert, Toyran, & Yurdakok, 2002). Although further research is needed to check whether such relations have obtained because parents are more likely to set children with attention problems in front of the television, at least one study suggests this is not the case: fourth- and fifth-graders’ television watching was related only to their teachers’, not their parents’, perception of their difficulty in paying attention. In addition, 1-year-olds are well below the age when ADHD is usually diagnosed. I would speculate that television and some computer programs work against children’s ability to regulate their attention because these media are often so attention grabbing that the children have no work to do on their own. The Montessori materials, in contrast, seem to meet children halfway. The materials are interesting and engrossing, but still require children to regulate their own attention.

In meditation, one’s task is to attend fully to the here and now. Meditation can be seen as an attention-training exercise. After meditation, people report feeling calm and refreshed. Studies suggest that people who engage in meditation derive lasting mental and physical health benefits from it. In one study, people who had applied for a course in mindfulness meditation were divided into two groups, one of which was given the course, and the other of which was told the course was full (Davidson et al., 2003). This made an excellent control group, since it eliminated the possibility that the meditators had differed to begin with. Whereas other studies have shown differences in the patterns of neural activation of meditators during meditation courses, this study was unusual in looking at people several months after the meditation course was completed. Meditators (who were still engaged in regular meditation sessions) at that point had more activation in the left hemisphere than the right hemisphere of their brains. This pattern is typical of people during meditation courses and is generally considered a “happy pattern.” People with stronger left than right hemisphere activation at rest report higher levels of well-being, presumably because they have a stronger approach than avoidance tendencies (Urry et al., 2004). Interestingly, even several months after the course, the meditators also had a stronger immune response to a flu vaccine, suggesting they might be less likely to become ill as well.

Dr. Montessori used the example of caterpillars moving toward light at a particular time of life, when going to light aids their development by bringing them to the soft young leaves at the ends of the tree branches. Caterpillars have no way of knowing that going to light will provide good food; they are biologically programmed to do so. As they become more mature, coincident with no longer needing the tender leaves, they no longer have such a drive. Dr. Montessori believed this same principle governed the psychological development of the human child. “Psychic development does not come about by hazard, and does not originate in stimuli from the outer world; it is guided by transient sensibilities, temporary instincts connected with the acquisition of certain characteristics” (Montessori, 1939, p. 44)",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 04),cleaned_ch04-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,32

In the psychologist’s definition today, emphasis is on the fact that if proper input is not provided during a sensitive period, the learning will never be acquired, at least not as easily or as well, as it would have during that period. For example, if a child is not given normal visual input during a certain period of postnatal development, the child’s vision will never be normal. In both the biological and the psychological literatures, sensitive periods are not necessarily mentioned with respect to interest (although the moderate discrepancy hypothesis, described in chapter 3 as well as later in this chapter, can be viewed that way). For Dr. Montessori, sensitive periods are periods of intense interest in particular stimuli that aid psychological development. In discussing these periods, Dr. Montessori suggested modularity, the idea that the human mind is composed of modules that carry out specific psychological functions (Fodor, 1983).

For example, while language is developing on the one hand, the judgment of distances and of finding one’s way about, is developing quite separately; so is the power to balance on two feet, and other forms of co-ordination. Each of these powers has its own special interest and this form of sensitivity is so lively that it leads its possessor to perform a certain series of actions. None of these sensitivities occupies the whole period of development. Each of them lasts long enough for the construction of a psychic organ.

Not the possession of language in itself, but the possession of this mechanism which enables men to make languages of their own, is what distinguishes the human species.

She noted that during this period children get upset if someone who usually wears a hat is not wearing one, or if a chair that is always in one place gets moved to a different place.

During this time, they are also meticulous about following specific steps in specific ways, perhaps as an outgrowth of the need for order. Older children are less concerned, she noted, with following steps precisely. Montessori education plays to this observed early sensitivity by providing very specific steps for Primary children’s activities, as is described for the Practical Life activities in chapter 9 (and touched on in chapter 2).

cleaned_ch04-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p43,"Interests as Biologically Motivated and Adaptive - The Research: Next I consider a prominent idea in developmental psychology today that bears on Dr. Montessori’s ideas: namely that interests or preferences are adaptive. Like Dr. Montessori, developmental psychologists today theorize that what children freely choose — what they are interested in — is sometimes internally guided by what they need at the moment for optimal development. In other words, cognitive systems might be tuned to seek out what they need to advance to further stages of development. This is not, of course, because of any conscious knowledge on the child’s part about optimal development, but because neural systems have evolved such that optimal choices are the ones that usually win out. As mentioned in the previous chapter, this claim has been called the moderate discrepancy hypothesis (McCall, Kennedy, & Appelbaum, 1977). The idea is that children seek out stimuli that are moderately discrepant from what they already have understood. Early experimental evidence for this showed that with children, adults, and even rats, attention is sustained longest if stimuli are at an intermediate level of novelty for the perceiver, neither too simple nor too complex (Berlyne, 1960). In vision research, developmental psychologists claim that children are drawn to look at patterns that are at the right level of complexity for their visual development. Here is how this principle is explained in one Developmental Psychology textbook:",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 04),cleaned_ch04-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,43

Most investigators now believe that babies are attracted to the displays that offer the most edge contrasts that they can see at a particular age (Banks & Ginsburg, 1985). Why? Perhaps these findings suggest what babies are trying to accomplish with their visual behavior. When babies move their eyes over edges, they activate cells of the visual areas of the brain. The strongest brain activity occurs when the baby adjusts the eye so that images of the edges fall near the center of the eye—that is, when the baby looks straight at the edges. Also, the more detail the baby can see, the stronger the activation. Haith (1980) has suggested that the baby’s visual activity in early infancy reflects a biological “agenda” for the baby to keep brain-cell firing at a high level. This agenda makes sense because, as we have seen, cells in the brain compete to establish connections to other cells. Activity tends to stabilize the required connections, while inactive pathways deteriorate (Greenough, Black, & Wallace, 1987).

Given the choice of listening to sounds that fall within or outside the range of the human voice, even 1-month-olds prefer to listen to sounds in the range of the voice (Aslin, Juscyzk, & Pisoni, 1998). Infants also prefer voices talking “baby talk” to those talking in adult-adult mode (Fernald, 1984), and even at birth they prefer the voice of their own mother to the voices of other women (De- Casper & Fifer, 1980). These preferences may be adaptive because they help to establish attachment relationships. Adaptiveness is of course usually mere speculation, and the moderate discrepancy hypothesis suffers from the fact that it is often difficult to state what is moderately discrepant for a particular infant.

It might also lead to work in biology on what different organisms eat and how their digestive systems operate. Likewise, a child who is particularly interested in horses can make charts on special breeds of horses and thereby master the principles of genetics, write reports on the history of domestication of horses and thereby learn about human history, write stories concerning horses and thereby develop creative writing, study the horses of Leonardo da Vinci and thus stimulate study of art history, and so on.

If learning in one topic area is believed to have no bearing on learning in another, then it follows that there would be no profit from integration of topics during education. In traditional schooling, therefore, as children get older, each topic even has its own teacher and is taught in its own classroom. At the beginning of each school year, children review what they learned in the prior grade, then proceed to the information they are supposed to learn in the current grade. Interest is clearly not driving the curriculum, and there is very little integration across topic areas.

Therefore, the teacher is responsible for watching the children very closely, aiming to present each material to each child at a time in the child’s development when that lesson will be particularly interesting. “The teacher will note whether or not the child is interested in the object, how he shows his interest, how long he is interested in it, and so on, and she will take care not to force a child’s interest in what she is offering” (Montessori, 1967b, p. 107). When the teacher realizes the timing is wrong, the teacher puts the material away and tries again later. Assisting with this task, many of the materials have a predetermined sequence that Dr. Montessori empirically tested and found worked well across children, with each material building on what came before. But not all materials work this way, and even those that do still need to be timed well. Montessori teachers are meant to observe the children carefully and to be sensitive to the timing of each lesson so as to elicit maximal interest. In contrast, in traditional schools, teachers have a syllabus set at the beginning of the year, and this guides the timing of lessons.",Traditional,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 04),cleaned_ch04-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,86

They are trying to get hold of words, and they often demonstrate this fact by repeating joyously some word which they have been able to grasp. We should second this tendency in the child by giving him an abundant material and by organizing for him such exercises as his reactions clearly show us are suitable for him. The material used in our system not only is very abundant, but it has been dictated to us by rigid experimentation on every detail. However, the same successive choices of material do not appear among the children as a whole. Indeed their individual differences begin to assert themselves progressively at this point in their education. The exercises are easy for some children and very hard for others, nor is the order of selection the same among all the children. The teacher should know this material thoroughly. She should be able to recognize the favorable moment for presenting the material to the child.

Prior knowledge has clear effects on learning, which might result in part from interest. For example, activating prior knowledge structures can assist in storage and retrieval of new knowledge (Anderson, 1983). One classic example of this is presented in chapter 7: if one reads an ambiguous passage with no idea of what it is about, one will not remember the passage nearly as well as someone who reads the ambiguous passage with some prior knowledge of what it was about (Bransford & Johnson, 1972). Although interest was not assessed in this experiment, I would guess that the people who knew the passage topic were also more interested in what they were reading. This also bears on the issue of using advance organizers in learning text materials. Students who review tables of contents, giving themselves some “prior knowledge” on which to hook the new incoming information, learn better than do those who simply take off on an uncharted journey through the chapter. Having some knowledge of a topic also stimulates learning, and it is quite possible that this is partly because prior knowledge stimulates interest.

By watching, the 3-year-old can learn the process and even some of the content of the activity he or she will later do. Learning a little about an activity by watching lends familiarity to that activity, which should then engender more interest in learning it. In addition, of course, there is a motivating element in that older children do that activity. When the teacher shows a child how to do the Movable Alphabet, the child has the sense that she has advanced to doing what the older children do, and that is likely to make it all the more interesting. Research presented in chapter 6 shows that children’s observational learning is enhanced when they see slightly older peers engaged in an activity.

In contrast, Dr. Montessori believed that there should be one teacher in each classroom and no more (although there might be a non-teaching assistant to the teacher, particularly in Primary). Clearly a single teacher cannot be an expert in every subject; instead, the Montessori teacher’s principal job is to connect children to the environment. “The teacher’s principal duty [is to] explain the use of the material. [The teacher] is the main connecting link between the material . . . and the child” (Montessori, 1967b, p. 151).

People with mastery orientations, in brief, are people who are interested in learning in order to master a topic. They tend to like challenges, and they persist at them. People with performance goals, in contrast, tend to like to do easy jobs that make them look good. They want to be judged positively. Although these two different orientations appear to characterize different people, the same person can adopt different orientations under different environmental conditions. And it ends up that the particular conditions under which people are more apt to adopt mastery goals bear striking similarities to Montessori environments (Ames, 1992, see chapter 5). For example, Montessori has no tests or grades. As will be discussed in chapter 5, when children are given tests and graded or otherwise rewarded for their performance on those tests, they tend to adopt performance orientations, and therefore choose tests that are of a lower level. If they are not offered extrinsic rewards, they tend to adopt mastery goals, and thus choose challenging tasks. In a Montessori classroom, all rewards are intrinsic. Children learn because the work is interesting, not because they have to bring home a report card. This in itself might go some way toward eliminating the problem of children doing only what they are already good at.

To do this, teachers need to keep track of what children do in order to see if they are avoiding certain activities. Many people wonder how teachers can manage this in the absence of the factory model of whole-class learning. In a Primary Montessori class, a teacher may be able to keep track of where children are in the sequence of different work in his or her head, and will notice if a child is not progressing in an area at the rate that would be expected. Children should get through the three-year sequence of activities for a level in the three years they are in that classroom. For Elementary, few teachers can keep track of it all in their heads because there is a much larger number of lessons and materials. In Elementary, the teacher might keep track of where each child is in the sequence with a chart in a teacher’s closet or another system she or he has developed. In addition, in Elementary, children keep track of their own work in a Work Journal, the notebook mentioned in chapter 3 in which a child records all his or her activities, from arrival in the morning to departure in the afternoon, with times. For example, an entry for one day might begin, “8:10–9:25: Horse report. Three books investigated for information. 9:38–10:14: Soccer. 10:19–11:06: Bank Game. Three problems with a three-digit multiplier.” The child and teacher together, usually once weekly, go over the work the child has recorded in his or her Journal.

This result often surprises people, but the research supporting it is very strong. Learning is something young children are interested in and are intrinsically motivated to do. Few of us have ever seen or even heard of a three- or four-year-old with a “motivational deficit.” Instead, young children seem eager and excited about learning of all sorts, and the more typical parental complaints concern their children’s apparently insatiable curiosity and boundless energy. Yet, by the time these same children have entered school, a sizable fraction are quickly labeled as having motivational difficulties of one sort or another in learning.

Several other negative effects were observed in addition to reduced motivation, but the motivation finding was common to all three studies. In one study involving preschool children, Mark Lepper and his colleagues placed new sets of markers in classrooms of 3- to 5-year-olds (Lepper, Greene, & Nisbett, 1973) and watched to see which children used them a lot. Heavy marker users were then brought, one at a time, to a testing room, and a third of them were immediately shown a “Good Player Award”— a fancy note card with a big gold star and a red ribbon. They were asked if they would like to receive a Good Player Award, and all the children assented. They were told that all they had to do to win the award was draw with the markers. After each child had drawn for six minutes, a Good Player Award was placed with great fanfare on an “Honor Roll Board.” For the other two conditions, children were simply allowed to draw with the markers for six minutes and then were unexpectedly given a Good Player Award, or they drew for six minutes and no award was ever mentioned.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 05),cleaned_ch05-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,13

A tradition of research in behavior modification shows that rewards can enhance performance when there is a set, algorithmic solution to a problem. This is perhaps related to the fact that rewards appear to enhance performance on low-interest tasks (Cameron, Banko, & Pierce, 2001). This might apply to older children in school, since their intrinsic motivation to learn in school has diminished (Eccles, Wigfield, et al., 1993; Harter, 1981). Yet if their interest has diminished in part because of grades, then the practice creates a vicious cycle. Second, rewards are often effective at the moment of their offering, so if there are no long-term goals, rewards help without causing harm down the road. Third, some studies, discussed in chapter 6, also suggest that peer learning programs work well when rewards are given to a group for the group’s performance. However, this might be because these studies have been conducted in schools with older children.

Yet a large number of studies, some of which are reviewed in this chapter, and a more recent meta-analysis (Deci et al., 1999), provide convincing evidence that the reward structure that exists for much of school learning has serious negative consequences for subsequent motivation (see Sansone & Harackiewicz, 2000) as well as for performance, creativity, prosocial behavior, self theories, and classroom environments.

Notably, the negative effects tend to occur only when the reward is expected and the activity was already of interest. But they hold across many types of activities and types of rewards, and even hold for evaluation. One example of a different sort of activity is the game of pinball, which many undergraduates are intrinsically motivated to play (Harackiewicz, Manderlink, & Sansone, 1984).

In another study, two activities of equal and high inherent initial interest were presented to preschoolers. One group of children was told to engage in one of the activities so that they could later engage in the second one. Other children were simply told to engage in one activity, and then the other one, without it seeming as though the second were contingent on the first. About three weeks later, observer noted that during free time, children who had participated in the contingent activity condition showed decreased interest in whichever activity they had first, and increased interest in the second activity.

Across these experiments, tangible and expected rewards were found to reliably interfere with subsequent motivation when participants later chose whether to engage in the task. Verbal rewards (such as praise) that were not given in a controlling style increased intrinsic motivation, but only for college students, not for children; the authors cautioned that this may have been because verbal rewards were generally unexpected and the negative impact of rewards is most reliably seen when the rewards are expected.

Results from tests taken under such conditions are therefore probably not indicative of long-term knowledge gains.

Whereas mastery goals are associated with better learning at younger ages, this ceases to be the case for students in high school and college. Why would this be the case? Because of drop-out, many of the performance-oriented children in the high school sample may have been higher-achieving students to begin with, whereas low-performing entity theorists would be more likely to have found the reward system discouraging, perhaps leading them to have dropped out of school by then. Some of the initially mastery-oriented children will have adopted performance goals by this time, replacing the drop-outs in the sample.

The countries are painted different colors, and each has a knob allowing it to be easily lifted out.

The countries are then colored in on the new map, in the same colors as are on the wooden map from which they traced the countries. Finally, the child writes a label for each country. Rather than turning these maps in to the teacher, who in a traditional system would then notice and correct errors, children get a “Control Map” to which they refer: a labeled map against which to check their work. Because there are no grades, and the learning goal is kept paramount, there is no sense in which children would be cheating if they were to refer to the control map too early.

By assembling the Pink Tower over and over again, the children come to do it correctly. By doing the Multiplication Board over and over, children come to memorize the multiplication tables. If children sometimes make errors along on the way, they will see their error through the control materials, and through repetition they come to do it right. According to Montessori theory, we have a human tendency toward perfection. This postulated tendency is reminiscent of what the psychologist Michael Kubovy calls virtuosity: humans the world over take pleasure in doing things well (1999). In keeping with this postulated love of mastery, Dr. Montessori observed that children do repeat the exercises over and over. If the environment provides feedback so that children do not keep repeating the same errors, and children are driven to repeat exercises until they can do them perfectly, then they will eventually master them; there is no need for teachers to correct children on the errors that surely do occur, especially early on.",Montessori,,Material,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 05),cleaned_ch05-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,95

The three periods might be thought of as association, recognition, and recall. These nomenclature lessons figure prominently in Primary, because Dr. Montessori believed children should have precise terminology for describing the world and, as previously noted, she believed the first five years are a sensitive period for acquiring vocabulary (Montessori, 1967a).

The teacher would then repeat the presentation another day. If the child did correctly choose the rough one, the teacher would go on to the third period, holding up one of the sandpaper tablets and asking the child, “What is this?” A great deal of vocabulary is taught in the Primary classrooms through such lessons, and they give the teacher an opportunity to evaluate whether a child has mastered key concepts.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 05),cleaned_ch05-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,97

While in that spot, though, they are not punished: they are given their favorite activities to do. Their punishment is the loss of freedom. Occasionally the teacher will turn to the problem child with great sympathy and give her or him sympathetic attention.

Two of Dr. Montessori’s theoretical views align with such observations. First, like Piaget (and perhaps his views derived from hers, or both their views might have derived from some other, common source), she believed that pretend is “not a proof of imagination, rather it is a proof of unsatisfied desire” (Montessori, 1997, p. 41). Pretending was thus assimilation to the ego, rather than adaptation to reality. The child’s task is to adapt to reality, so for adults to encourage fantasy was to encourage the child toward something that deviates from the developmental path he or she is on.

Regarding Christmas myths, she said, “How is it possible for the child’s imagination to be developed by that which is in truth the fruit of the adult’s imagination? We alone imagine, not they; they merely believe. . . . Credulity is indeed a characteristic of an immature mind which is lacking in experience” (1997, p. 43).

This is the parents’ intention, and American culture convenes to create an elaborate hoax, with Santa at the mall and even in schools at times. It is not surprising that until children are old enough to understand the impossibility of the tale, they believe it. What about more everyday items? On the one hand, I have made the point in some of my research that if children were not able to differentiate between pretend and real, early pretense events (such as drinking from an empty cup) should really confuse them (A. Lillard & Witherington, 2004). Instead, children seem to be mainly confused about emotional pretense events; for example, when someone is pretending to be a monster, they will say it is too scary. Most of the time, they seem to interpret everyday pretense events, such as pretend tea parties, as pretense. It might be that adults clearly mark these events as pretense, and children are able to keep them separate.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 05),cleaned_ch05-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,118

Books for children, for example, often convey animals engaging in human activities and experiencing human emotions. Do these confuse children’s understanding of animals? Some research suggests that children under the age of 4 or 5 are actually confused by such stories. For example, they do not do particularly well at sorting fantasy and real characters into different piles (Samuels & Taylor, 1994). Another study showed that they accept the anthropomorphic information about objects as real. Three-year-olds in one classroom were read a realistic book about trains, and those in another classroom were read a fantasy book, in which a train had a mother, got sad when something bad happened, and so on (Ganea, Richert, Bean, & De- Loache, 2004). After two readings of each book, a few days apart, children were taken aside individually and asked a series of questions about real trains. Children who were read the fantasy book were significantly more likely to have wrong ideas about real trains, by claiming, for example, that they have parents and feelings. These preliminary results require confirmation, but if they hold, they suggest that young children’s notions of what is real are surprisingly malleable. Whether such confusion is ultimately negative for children is an issue for empirical research. For example, does learning incorrect facts about trains interfere with learning correct ones later, or does it increase interest in trains and thereby improve later learning?",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 05),cleaned_ch05-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,119

Particularly in Dr. Montessori’s era, such fantasy figures as Santa Claus and the Sandman were often used in a manipulative fashion, to get children to behave well.

In other words, they cannot take the Pink Tower and make a small village from it, or animate the Cylinders as if they were people. The reason behind this injunction is that every material in the classroom was designed to serve a specific purpose, and Dr. Montessori believed that children needed to respect those purposes in order to get the intended value from the material. Montessori materials are not toys so much as specific tools to support specific developmental advances, according to Dr. Montessori. If the child needs blocks for building or dolls for animating, they should have materials for that, rather than using materials whose purposes are to teach about dimension, for example. Learning that items in the world have special purposes — glasses for drinking, microscopes for observing tiny things, and so on — is an important lesson. In addition, work by Judy DeLoache, discussed in chapter 2, suggests that when children play with objects, they are less likely to access those objects’ underlying symbolic features. This suggests that Montessori teachers might have direct didactic reasons for requiring that children use Montessori materials only in the ways in which they were intended to be used. Future research might examine whether this injunction does assist development.

For example, if the task is planning a route for doing a set of errands as efficiently as possible, child pairs will get the errands done, but not as efficiently, because they focus on each individual item to be retrieved separately, rather than thinking about how several items can be grouped to make for more efficient routes. Adult tutors get children to think about grouping items. However, when the peer tutor is trained in this task and taught to consider how to group items, tutee performance does improve.

Other children can become autocratic, as children are inclined to focus on who gets to do what. Children tend to like to do; adults more easily sit back, watch, and guide. Research has shown that peer learning is also more successful when peers listen to each other and question each other more (reviewed below), skills that many adults have but many children have not yet learned (Gauvain & Rogoff, 1989). Thus, a second problem for peer tutors is that when the task is not structured in a way that relegates roles, and the task involves doing, peer tutors tend to want to do the task and control the interaction, which makes them less effective than adult tutors. For this reason again, structured or scripted peer tutoring programs are more effective.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 06),cleaned_ch06-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,50
cleaned_ch06-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p51,"Optimal Level of Peer Tutee: Perhaps in part because peer tutors can become autocratic, some research suggests that, when tutored by a peer, the tutee benefits maximally from a peer who is just a bit more advanced rather than much more advanced. For example, research on both scientific and moral reasoning has shown that children benefit from exposure to thought processes that are just above their current level (Damon & Killen, 1982; Kuhn, 1972; Turiel & Rothman, 1972). This makes sense within both a Piagetian and a Vygotskian framework. For Piaget, if the peer’s thought processes are too advanced, the tutee cannot accommodate his mental structures to fit the new information. Likewise, if the peer is operating above the tutee’s zone of proximal development, the tutee cannot adopt the new reasoning or behavior. The success of slightly older peers in these frameworks would stem from their being able to adapt their own behaviors to more closely match the child’s level.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 06),cleaned_ch06-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,51
cleaned_ch06-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p52,"Besides being less able to adapt to a lower level of tutee, much older and more advanced peer tutors sometimes practice social dominance. The problems of autocracy mentioned earlier thus become exacerbated, and the tutee learns less, because he or she is less involved in the decision-making process. This was found in a study in which 5-year-old novices were paired either with 5- or 7-year-olds who were considered experts at planning routes (as in the study just described) (Duran & Gauvain, 1993). Children were more involved with the task when paired with an advanced planner of their own age, as opposed to an older planner, and this increased involvement predicted better performance. Whether the particular age gap used in this experiment (5 to 7) is a particularly problematic one would be an interesting topic for research. The age of 6 is a pivotal one, recognized in many of the world’s cultures as an appropriate time to ask more of children, such as by beginning formal schooling (Rogoff, 1981). Six is the age at which Piaget speculated children advance to being able to perform mental operations (for example, imagining addition and subtraction), and which Dr. Montessori considered transitional between her first and second planes of development. At each plane, she said, children think differently. Examining whether 6- and 8-, or 7- and 9-year-olds, make more effective tutoring pairs would be of interest. The research suggests that peers who are slightly advanced, but not too advanced, make more optimal tutors, but it might also be the case that tutors who are within particular age spans are best.",Montessori,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 06),cleaned_ch06-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,52

But, in the first place, he does not teach all the time and his freedom is respected. Second, teaching helps him to understand what he knows even better than before. He has to analyze and rearrange his little store of knowledge before he can pass it on. — Maria Montessori (1967a, p. 227)",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 06),cleaned_ch06-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,59

Informally, younger children can learn from older ones in Montessori by asking them questions while watching them work. More formally, at the teacher’s discretion, children in Montessori also sometimes show each other how to use a material. As discussed, both tutors and tutees benefit from peer teaching arrangements, raising levels of both motivation and performance. Children who are teaching learn by doing so, and children who learn from other children often learn very well. Because the use of Montessori materials is very structured, it suits the condition that peer tutoring is most effective when the tutor’s teaching steps are spelled out clearly. In addition, because children tend to request help from their friends, and friends are generally less likely to try to dominate each other, the problem of social dominance interfering with learning in some tutoring situations is probably alleviated.",Montessori,,Material,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 06),cleaned_ch06-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,60

Another peer tutoring opportunity that occurs naturally in Montessori education is that when children work together on any material, they are always in a position to watch and help one another. An older child might even simply stop to help after noticing a problem in a younger child’s work. The frequency with which such assistance occurs would be interesting to know, but clearly a Montessori setting is conducive to it.

Several studies show that people learn better when working collaboratively than when working alone (Azmitia & Crowley, 2001; P. A.

As with peer tutoring, the benefits of collaborative learning arrangements extend beyond academic achievement to improve the social climate of the classroom (social relations, discipline, and so on) and enhance individual well-being (Aronson, 2002; Johnson & Johnson, 1983; Maheady, 1998; Wright & Cowen, 1985).

cleaned_ch06-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p64,"The psychologist Elliot Aronson designed the Jigsaw program initially to address the disturbances that followed the integration of public schools in Austin, Texas, in the 1960s (Aronson & Patnoe, 1997). He reasoned that close student contact, for the purpose of helping others, might alleviate problems, and so created learning arrangements that would lead to such contact. In the Jigsaw model, children are placed in groups of five or six and topics of study are broken into as many segments. For the topic of the Civil War, for example, one person might be assigned to study the history of slavery, another the type of weapons used in the era, another the major battles, and so on. Children research their topic on their own, and then temporarily join a new group composed of the child from every other group in the class who was assigned their same topic. These “homogenous” groups share information and practice presentations of their topics. Finally, children reunite with their original groups, and each child teaches the material. A test on all the material generally follows. The Jigsaw method has repeatedly been found to improve learning as well as classroom social relations (Aronson, 2002; Bridgeman, 1981; Lazarowitz, Hertz-Lazarowitz, & Baird, 1994). In terms of academic achievement, it is particularly successful with minority youths, but in some cases it has improved, and in no cases (to my knowledge) has it negatively affected, the learning of other students (Lucker, Rosenfield, Sikes, & Aronson, 1977; Slavin, 1983).",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 06),cleaned_ch06-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,64

Children who worked together and were encouraged to talk were most likely to solve the puzzles and produced the most interpretive talk. Even when children were alone and encouraged to talk to themselves, their use of interpretive talk was positively related to their ability to solve the puzzles. Descriptive talk, which is more characteristic of children in the kindergarten years, was associated with low levels of performance on the problem-solving tasks. The children who performed the worst were ones who worked alongside others but were discouraged from talking at all, which is the typical arrangement in traditional elementary schools. In contrast, children at these ages in Montessori schools tend to work together, and they frequently talk while they work.

For example, on a task in which children have to figure out how to make a balance beam balance, children who were strong proponents of an incorrect theory (such as that distance from the center of the beam does not matter) were least apt to benefit from collaboration. Unfortunately, a factory approach to schooling cannot accommodate individual readiness to learn.

The customer may say to the teller, “I want 8,642 multiplied by 34.” The children then decompose the multiplicand into its categorical parts (thousands, hundreds and so on), and then do the same for the multiplier. They lay out cards showing the problem and begin their series of multiplications category by category. The teller then gives the banker the first transaction: “I would like to have the product of 4 x 2, please.” The banker offers the customer the card for 8 units. The teller continues through each of the subproblems one at a time, collecting the cards, after which the teller sums them to arrive at the final product. The teller carries that number back to the customer, who checks the work. The material is designed to be used collaboratively, and having the social roles of banker, teller, and customer may enhance its interest for children.

Collaborative arrangements at older grades may require rewards because children by those ages are accustomed to working for tangible, expected rewards in school, and if there are no rewards (intrinsic or extrinsic) for learning and they are with their peers, they would rather socialize than engage in school tasks. As the Montessori Middle School study cited earlier suggested, children in traditional schools tend to feel relatively disaffected when engaged in schoolwork, and they are more motivated when engaged in nonacademic tasks (Rathunde & Csikszentmihalyi, in press). If intrinsic motivation to learn in school had not been previously disrupted, as the research suggests it probably has (Harter, 1981), perhaps extrinsic rewards would not be necessary in peer tutoring and collaborative learning studies in traditional schools.",Traditional,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 06),cleaned_ch06-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,89

When the road to success is clearly demarcated, rewards are not harmful. In keeping with this, the education researcher Robert Slavin (1996) proposed that controversial tasks without single answers might not require a group reward structure to achieve successful outcomes. Examples of this would be debates and other kinds of structured controversy where students are exposed to others’ thought processes by virtue of engaging in the task.

Piagetian and Vygotskian perspectives are compatible with this view. Clearly this sort of process occurs in observational learning. In one illustration of this, pairs of 5-year-olds were asked to recreate a Lego figure from a sample (Azmitia, 1988). Experts behaved differently toward the model than novices, in that expert Lego builders looked a lot at the model. Novices benefited from being paired with an expert peer, but this was mediated by the extent to which they watched and imitated the expert. In particular, novices who were paired with experts and later went on to look a lot at the model themselves were more adept at building Lego forms that matched a sample. This study shows how observing others solve problems can directly impact how a child goes on to solve a problem him- or herself. Observation and imitation, themselves important processes in peer learning, also serve collaborative learning, because children can incorporate a peer’s behavior into their own repertoires.

In a study of moral development, children were found to advance more in moral reasoning after discussing moral dilemmas with classmates than with their mothers, and this finding appeared to hinge on the degree to which transactive reasoning was used in discussion of the dilemmas (Kruger, 1992).

Involved students brought their own outside material to the classroom—books, newspaper articles, and reports from television news.

Traditional schools separate children during the learning process, in the sense that children are not supposed to talk to or interact with each other during class. Children try desperately to interact during lecture time in school, passing notes, whispering, and winking, but they usually must wait for recess, lunch, and after school to openly engage in the social interaction that is apparently so desirable. Collaborative learning might achieve its success in part by allowing children to interact socially during these very social years, and through motivating the learning process by having it take place in the context of that highly desired interaction.

Physically separating the learning context from the context of use can be desirable: clients would normally prefer their accountants learn the tax code in a classroom rather than in an appointment (Anderson, Reder, & Simon, 1996). Some have argued, however, that the divide between school and contexts of use has a negative impact on learning, and that learners are better served when learning is “situated” in the context in which it will be used (e.g., Lave & Wenger, 1991). Internships are a clear case of learning in the context of use. Internships exist because some skills and knowledge seem to be better learned at the point of need, where there is contextual support for learning. In addition, learning is motivated by the context in which it is needed.

cleaned_ch07-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p4,"Related to this is the second way in which school learning is separated from life: conceptually. Even in a separate setting, learning can be embedded in examples and contexts that have meaning for the learner, and often can be readily applied to real life settings. But if one’s model of the learner is an empty vessel, context should not matter. One can pour information into the same vessel just as well in a factory as on a farm. In fact, from his finding that knowledge could not transfer across situations, Thorndike seemed to take the message that learning should be stripped of all context. His writings on teaching refer to the stimuli presented by the teacher, not to the context in which those stimuli are presented. Even today, in traditional school classrooms using standard textbooks, the importance of meaningful contexts for engaging minds and enhancing learning is often neglected. Word problems in math textbooks ask about hypothetical people engaged in activities that often have nothing to do with the lives of the children working the problems. History has traditionally been taught as a series of people, places, and dates to memorize, and only in the hands of more gifted teachers can children see how the learning relates to their own lives. Vocabulary is taught in lists taken from workbooks made by someone else, someplace else, rather than stemming organically from what a child currently needs to know to describe something more precisely. School learning is thus conceptually removed from contexts and issues whose importance is clear to the children. In fact, the grade based reward structure can be thought of as a substitute motivating device, given the inherent lack of intrinsically motivating contexts in traditional schooling.

For example, if chess pieces are arranged in a way that reflects their possible placement in a real game of chess, then chess experts (both child and adult) recall the placement of pieces much better than do novice players. However, if the chess pieces are randomly placed on the board and do not reflect the organization of a real game, then chess experts are no better at recalling their placement than are chess novices (Chase & Simon, 1988). Expertise apparently confers knowledge structures that influence memory, but only when the information supplied conforms to those structures.

These experts also appeared to reason about racing at a higher level than the nonexperts. When asked to handicap races, to determine how much extra weight a horse should carry to equalize the chances of each horse winning, they used a complex multiplicative model. In contrast, those with less expertise used a simpler additive model.

Montessori capitalizes on this by giving children new information at the point of need. Vocabulary learning is one example of this. In traditional schooling, vocabulary is often taught from lists of words, often in commercial workbooks; children need to look up definitions and use the words in sentences they might make up, or that might even be made up by the textbook developers, with the child’s task being merely to insert the correct word.

Primary children thus learn the words “stamen,” pistil,” and so on, in the context of a real plant and their own drawings of it. The vocabulary allows children to precisely describe objects in the classroom and the world. In Elementary, much new vocabulary comes across in the process of writing reports, which constitute a large part of Montessori Elementary education (as opposed to an occasional exercise in most grade schools).

cleaned_ch07-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt_p54,"Stories as Contexts For Learning: The psychologist Jerome Bruner is a strong proponent of the view that “we organize our experience and our memory of human happenings mainly in the form of narrative — stories, excuses, myths, reasons for doing and not doing, and so on” (1991, p. 4). Humans by nature find meaning in narrative. The five Great Lessons in Elementary (introduced in chapter 4) and many of the Key Lessons that follow them are narratives, hence the core of the Elementary curriculum is given in a structure that people inherently find meaningful. Because the stories are told with attention to interconnections, they lend an interconnected organizational structure to the children’s representation of the knowledge. When a Montessori teacher engages the child’s imagination in stories, he or she connects the new information to the child’s prior knowledge and to hands-on materials and demonstrations that go along with the stories. Recall that in the introduction to water, described in chapter 4, Dr. Montessori related water to such other elements as animals and mathematics. As in all good stories, the descriptions were given in concrete terms, for example, equating the mountains under the ocean with mountains above ground that children have seen, and describing the size of a school of fish in terms of how long it would take a boat to get around it. The human imagination resonates to such images. The story of the Rope Stretchers, also in chapter 4, is another example of this: a historical tale is used to get across a mathematical concept. Children come to the geometric formula in the same way Pythagoras did (as the story goes), and the formula may take on added interest as one thinks of it in the real and practical context of people needing to redraw property lines after a flood. Images abound in Montessori lessons. For example, a lesson on the atmosphere’s getting thinner at higher altitudes is given in terms of the air being in layers, like a pile of blankets. Closer to the earth’s center are more, thicker blankets, and the blankets become fewer and thinner as one goes out. Children become fascinated by such images and are inspired to repeat the lesson on Air and Atmosphere again and again.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 07),cleaned_ch07-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,54

Such contextualization would be expected to facilitate comprehension. The stories are of course intended to inspire children to study aspects of them, for example, to go on to do experiments about the three forms of water (solid, liquid, and gas), and the mathematical composition of water. Relating back to issues raised in chapter 4, this personally motivating engagement is surely also important. When teachers are trained in Montessori education, the training refers explicitly to creating contexts for children, connecting ideas to what they know and helping children see the meaning. In traditional teacher training, this could be done in the abstract, but it could never be done with regard to specifics, because the teachers will go on to schools where they will surely use different textbooks and have different information to teach. In traditional Montessori teacher training, it is done with regard to the specific lessons the teacher will be teaching, because the lessons are essentially the same in all traditional Montessori classrooms. Teachers might build on these lessons in particular ways, but specific means to helping children see meaning in the lessons are given in the teacher training. The Montessori lessons have been described as a gift that frees the teacher to focus on individual children and their needs. In other schools, in contrast, teachers spend a good deal of time making up their own lessons, then revising them when an administrator or politician changes the academic program.",Traditional,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 07),cleaned_ch07-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,55

The collaborative nature of learning in Montessori provides a context that might also facilitate learning by making it more personally meaningful to children. As was seen in chapter 6, when people learn while knowing they might impart the information to others (in order to teach), they learn better, and this might be in part because the information now has connections beyond oneself. Children in the Jasper project described earlier were so motivated to write books to be shared with others that teachers made a rule: “No leaving recess early to go back to class to work on your book” (Bransford et al., 1999, p. 61). Montessori children know they might teach another child about a material, and that they might share with the class the knowledge they acquire in writing a report. Since Elementary children are usually working on reports with others, sharing also occurs in the context of discovering new knowledge. Children seem to like to share the knowledge they acquire, and knowing they will present material to others gives the learning an additional purpose.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 07),cleaned_ch07-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,56

For example, there is a big couch in the big room, and a miniature version of it, in the same relative location and with the same slipcover, in the model room. There is a big table in the big room, and a miniature model of it, again in the same relative place in the model room. After pointing out the similarity across the two spaces, the experimenter shows the child a big Snoopy animal and a miniature model of it. In full view of the child, the little Snoopy is hidden in a place in the model, perhaps under a pillow on the miniature couch. The child is told, “Now I’m going to go hide big Snoopy in the exact same place in his big room. You wait here.” The experimenter goes out of sight of the child and hides big Snoopy behind the big pillow on the big couch, returns, and reminds the child that big Snoopy is hidden in the same place in his big room as little Snoopy is in his little room.

The relevant point here is that the surface similarity of the model to the target can make a big difference to children’s competence. Performance declines, for example, if one changes the slipcovers on the furniture, or the shape of the table, making the similarity between the two spaces less obvious (see also Gentner & Toupin, 1986).

The problem with this kind of research is that one cannot always tell what the direction of effects is (did the parent create those behaviors in the child, or did the child bring those behaviors out of the parent?), or even whether some third variable (such as their genes) is responsible for the association of particular behaviors in one person with particular behaviors in another. Some studies are experimental, and thus do allow such inferences.

The construct of attachment was first discussed by the British ethnologist and psychoanalyst John Bowlby (1969) as an explanation for the failure of many babies to thrive in European orphanages following World War II: they lacked a close relationship with an adult. According to attachment theory, children need a close adult who will function as a secure base from which to explore the world, and who will be a safe haven to which to retreat in times of stress. The psychologist Mary Ainsworth (1967), Bowlby’s colleague, moved the attachment construct from the theoretical to the empirical realm by establishing a method to assess attachment.

Discussion following refers to maternal sensitivity because that was Ainsworth’s main concern, but the constructs seem to apply to any close caregiver. Important attachment relationships also of course develop with fathers (Grossmann et al. 2002), and they also appear to develop with day-care providers and teachers. Children growing up on Israeli kibbutzim become attached to their caregivers, and the quality of those relationships also predicts children’s outcomes (Oppenheim, Sagi, & Lamb, 1988). Children with a secure attachment to their kibbutz caregiver were later more goal directed and achievement oriented than were other children. This is consistent with work showing that American children’s relationships with their kindergarten teachers are related to their academic and behavioral outcomes through eighth grade (Hamre & Pianta, 2001).

After many years of controversy, the recent National Study of Day Care, involving a representative sample of over 1,000 American children in a variety of day-care arrangements, has shown that use of day care has no significant impact on child-mother attachment relations (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). It is the mother’s awareness of signals when she is with the infant that appears to matter, and not that she is with the infant at all times. One might revise Ainsworth’s criteria for awareness, then, to read that the adult must be proximate to the infant for some reasonable amount of time, and when proximate, must be able to perceive the infant’s signals.

After the first year, Ainsworth noted that doing exactly as the baby asks is no longer always the best response. As they get older, children increasingly need to adapt to the world, rather than always expecting the world to adapt to them. On the other hand, children also need to feel some sense of control or efficacy, as sug gested by the research presented in chapter 3.

Many studies have been done in the meantime, and the results are not as strong; some even fail to show a relationship. When results are inconsistent, the best response is a meta-analysis combining results across many studies. A recent meta-analysis of maternal sensitivity and attachment shows there is a relationship between the two factors, such that (in statistical terms) a child’s chances of being securely attached move from 38% if a mother is not sensitive to 62% if the mother is sensitive (De Wolff & van Ijzendoorn, 1997).

The obvious infant characteristic to consider is the child’s personality (or temperament), and studies have been done examining the relationship between child personality and attachment security (Vaughn & Bost, 1999).

But a mother’s interaction style with a child evolves over time. Other research has looked at how parents of securely attached infants behave toward them somewhat later, as toddlers and preschoolers. One can view this as addressing how the sensitive pattern of responding adapts as children age. Mothers whose children were insecurely attached as infants tend to interact more intrusively with them in first and second grades (Egeland, Pianta, & O’Brien, 1993). Their interaction styles are more directive, such that they are more apt to tell their children exactly what to do. In contrast, parents of securely attached children tend not simply to tell the children what to do, but instead make suggestions, helping children to figure things out for themselves (Fagot, Gauvain, & Kavanagh, 1996; Frankel & Bates, 1990; Matas et al., 1978; Moss, 1992). They are closely involved, but nonintrusive. In Bruner’s (1975) terms, echoing Vygotsky, parents of securely attached children provide ideal scaffolds for children, structuring the environment such that children can internalize problem-solving strategies (see also Gauvain, 2001), whereas parents of insecurely attached children are more directive.

Dr. Montessori saw concentration as the moment of self-development. Because of this theoretical stance, she held that teachers must watch for any concentrated purposeful movement, so as to let it go undisturbed; the child must be protected from stimuli that would break the concentration. For example, Dr. Montessori described an incident in which a child who had thus far been disorderly in school one day began to rearrange the furniture, with an expression of intense interest. The teacher was inclined to stop him, but Dr. Montessori saw his activity as coordinated toward a useful end, and manifesting that child’s first moments of concentration on purposeful activity in the classroom.

Parents were also rated for warmth, responsiveness, power assertion, inductive reasoning, demandingness, and restrictiveness. A factor analysis on the various ratings resulted in two factors: authoritative/democratic (high on warmth, suggestions, induction, demanding of maturity), or authoritarian/restrictive (high in prohibitions, directives, and power assertion).

Children must have “a teacher who looks on them with love and hope” (Montessori, 1989, p. 79). Yet at the same time, the adult’s ultimate control of the environment was clearly a high priority. The pitfalls of permissive adult attitudes were pointed out in her writing. “If freedom is understood as letting the children do as they like, using or more likely misusing, the things available, it is clear that only their ‘deviations’ are free to develop” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 206). Permissive parents are often thought of as ones who want to be their children’s friends; it is hard for them to exercise authority. Dr. Montessori saw the dangers in this: “The teacher must be superior and not just a friend. . . . [Children] need a dignified, mature person. . . . If they have no authority, they have no directive. Children need this support” (1989, p. 17). Some Montessori teachers, like some parents, err in this regard. They do not provide ultimate control over the environment, deal effectively with unproductive behaviors, or guide children’s decisions in positive ways. Freedom can thus be taken to an extreme, and Dr. Montessori counseled against this repeatedly. “One time I saw an entire class of disorganized children who were using the materials completely wrongly. The teacher drifted about in the class, silent as the Sphinx. . . . This teacher was committing a grave error: She feared disturbing their disorder, instead of attempting to establish the order” (Montessori, 1956, p. 140).",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 08),cleaned_ch08-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,55

Authoritarian parents tell children to do things because the parent says so; they do not reason with the child, and they appear to take on a stance that they are infallible. Yet adults who work with children have to admit to being fallible (Montessori, 1967a, p. 246). Education, she said, was traditionally “directed toward the suppression or bending of the child’s will, and the substitution for it of the teacher’s will, which demands from the child unquestioning obedience” (Montessori, 1967a, p. 252).

Longitudinal studies, examining teachers’ responses from year to year with different classes of children, would be needed to address that.

The Montessori’s teacher’s goal is clearly the child’s self-regulation; the teacher’s task was well done when the teacher was needed only to give additional lessons. “Any pedagogical action, if it is to be efficacious in the training of little children, must tend to help the children to advance upon this road of independence” (Montessori, 1912/ 1964, p. 97). Although the teacher oversees the Montessori classroom, it is truly the child’s classroom, with everything scaled to and arranged for the children. The children have responsibility to care for the environment: to return objects to their places, to behave civilly, to water plants, to clean up their spills, and so on. The teacher’s aim is to help children toward independence—to endorse their autonomy—while providing whatever guidance is necessary to ensure that the children make good decisions and engage in productive behaviors as they work toward that goal. The expectations and attitudes toward control that Dr. Montessori endorsed in teachers are consistent with the literature on optimal classroom practices.

Before concentration occurs, the directress may do more or less what she thinks best; she may interfere with the children’s activities as much as she thinks necessary” (1967a, p. 278). Dr. Montessori suggested that teachers begin with games, poetry, and singing, and activities to organize children’s physical movements. Such activities might include arranging furniture or going outside to collect leaves. As described in chapter 2, the first specifically Montessori activities Primary teachers introduce to new children are the Exercises of Practical Life, such as polishing the classroom water pitcher and dusting the shelves.

The teacher must give the disruptive child something else to do. “Interfere by all means to stop disturbances, but we need not punish or scold or admonish when we stop bad behavior; we can ask the child to come and pick flowers in the garden or offer a toy or any occupation that will appeal to [the child]” (Montessori, 1989, p. 16).

Dr. Montessori maintained that the capacity to observe children has to be carefully developed through long practice (1917/1965, p. 130). In the AMI Montessori teacher training courses, scores of hours are spent with children, observing their actions, recording those observations, and crafting them into reports to be reviewed by the teacher trainer. Dr. Montessori advocated training in science, rather than in education, for people who would go into Montessori teaching, in part because training in science is training in close observation (Montessori, 1917/1965, p. 138). She was also concerned that training in traditional education might make it more difficult to become a good Montessori teacher. “An ordinary teacher cannot be transformed into a Montessori teacher, but must be created anew, having rid herself of pedagogical prejudices” (Montessori, 1946/1963, p. 87).

Without this preparation we cannot give due weight to the minute things from which science draws its conclusions” (1917/1965, p. 133). In order to observe clearly, Dr. Montessori held that teachers must first confront their own prejudices. “We insist on the fact that a teacher must prepare himself interiorly by systematically studying himself so that he can tear out his most deeply rooted defects, those in fact which impede his relations with children. . . . A good teacher does not have to be entirely free from faults and weaknesses [but should know what they are]” (Montessori, 1966, p. 149). To assist this, part of teacher training, she claimed, was for the trainers to point out to the trainees what they saw in the trainee’s personalities, to urge honest personal assessment.

Some studies described in this chapter statistically control for likely third variables, but in the absence of experimental manipulation, the possibility remains that a third variable that is not controlled for is responsible for any relations. As an alternative to third variables, reverse directions of effects are also often plausible. Parents probably find it easier to enact orderly routines and keep an orderly house with children who are better at selfregulation, and perhaps the children “cause” the adult behavior. However, even if some reverse directions of effect are sometimes partly responsible for findings, it is likely that parent-to-child effects also occur.

One study, for example, revealed that having regular times for bed and nap was significantly related to the cognitive measure of object permanence at 15 months, indicated by a child removing a cover to retrieve a just-hidden object (Wachs, 1976). Object permanence has traditionally referred to a child’s knowing that an object exists independently of the child’s own action on it (Flavell, 1963); however, recent research shows that children know this well before they pass an objectpermanence task by manually searching for a covered object (Baillargeon, 1987). Instead, the traditional object-permanence task may tap into a child’s ability to coordinate actions with knowledge. As such, it may be related to a sense of “can-do” in children. Regularity and predictability in one’s daily schedule might promote such a sense; habitual uncertainty about will happen next would lead to having a diminished sense of control. In subsequent studies (Wachs & Gruen, 1982), the relationship between routines and object permanence appeared at somewhat different ages and sometimes only in males, but a general pattern of relationship is clear when considering the entire body of work. In families where there are set regular times and routines for major events, infants and toddlers are more cognitively advanced.",Traditional,Behavioral/Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 09),cleaned_ch09-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,24

These ask whether the child is taken to a doctor or clinic for medical care regularly, whether the child makes a trip to the grocery store at least weekly, and whether the child gets out of house at least four times a week. The latter item seems less obviously about temporal regularity—perhaps the child goes to the park at a different time each day—but it may often reflect whether the child has some set routine, such as regularly going to day care. At some level, one can see how these three items all tap into there being a regular schedule in the home. The two items that are more related to physical organization concern the child’s having a special place to keep toys and whether the child’s play space appears to be safe.

To address this, some researchers studied a sample consisting entirely of low SES children. Even within this group, the organization subscale of the HOME measured at 18 months was significantly related to Stanford-Binet performance, even controlling for maternal IQ, but only in a subset of the sample that spent 40 hours a week in the Frank Porter Graham day-care center, a highly successful intervention project (Ramey, Farran, & Campbell, 1979). Home organization was not predictive of IQ for children who were not in the center. The reasons for this are not clear. One possibility is that other variables have more influence in the absence of a day-care intervention. For example, in this study, maternal IQ was very predictive of later IQ scores for the control children, but not for children in the day-care intervention.

Repeating the ordered routines may be even more important to a sense of mastery than achieving the immediate goal of each routine.

Studies of human memory have shown that when information is presented in a conceptually organized way, as opposed to randomly, people learn it better. In one study, undergraduates were asked to memorize a list of words in a hierarchical tree structure (Bower, Clark, Lesgold, & Winzenz, 1969). For half of the undergraduates, the words were organized in the tree structure in a conceptually organized manner. For example, “Minerals” was listed at the top, and on the branches below “Metals” and “Stones” were listed, with stones divided into “Precious” and “Masonry,” and so on. The other half of the subjects saw the same tree structure, but the items were inserted into the tree randomly, thus “Masonry” might have been at the top, with “Precious” and “Metals” on the branches below.",Montessori,,Example,full_text_passage,Montessori Science Behind Genius (Chapter 09),cleaned_ch09-montessori-science-behind-genius.txt,61

This is something children have to do in traditional schools, for example with lists of unrelated vocabulary or spelling words, but rarely outside of school. If the unschooled children were given a structural organization that made sense to them, their memory capacities might prove equivalent to those of schooled children. The structural organization involved was a diorama of a miniature town, into which 20 small items, including animals, cars, people, and so on, were logically placed while the children, Maya and American 8- and 9-year-olds, looked on. The 20 objects were then replaced into the pool of 80 items from which they were drawn, and the children were asked to reconstruct the scene. Although the Maya sample had shown much poorer memory previously on a standard list task, their performance was even slightly better than that of the American children in this organized task.

As presented in chapter 1, this study showed that children who had been in Montessori fared as well or better than other children—who were mostly in programs for more gifted students—on standardized tests and in terms of such issues as school absence and delinquency. One would like to see much more thorough exploration of the lives of these graduates. Do they tend to have more productive and constructive careers? Are they more apt to aid humanity? Our standardized tests do not get at such issues. Even if they could, studies need the right control sample: children in both the Montessori and the non-Montessori treatment groups have to be randomly assigned, or we have to control for parent variables by using a group of lottery losers, people who wanted their children to get into Montessori schools but who were rejected based on random selection procedures.

Dewey and Dr. Montessori shared insights, and he slightly preceded her: Dewey’s first major publication came out in 1903, four years before the first Montessori school opened. However, it does not seem likely that she had read his work. America and Europe were a long oceanliner voyage apart, and although there was certainly some passage of ideas (Montessori was hailed in the United States and spent a year lecturing here in 1915), America and Europe were proceeding on different paths in the behavioral sciences, with experiment and behaviorism prominent in the United States and Europe turning from the sorts of experiments conducted by Wundt and others and following the very different path laid by Freud and psychoanalysis. Although quite aware of Pestalozzi, Froebel, and her other predecessors in Europe, Dr. Montessori seemed to know little about the state of American education.

Stanley Hall claimed empirical evidence that reading, writing, spelling, and math prior to age 8 were not positive for children’s development (Hall, 1911).

Many educational theorists have written about this issue. Lauren Resnick, mentioned in chapter 1, pointed out several reasons why schools still use a Lockean model of the child (in her terms, an “associationist theory of learning”) (Resnick & Hall, 1998). For one, education reform in the United States has mainly been about changing institutional arrangements (grouping, accountability, and management) and not about patterns of teaching and methods of pedagogy. The latter is left to teachers and local decision makers. Added to this are people’s tendency to teach as they were taught, expectations of parents that schools will look and feel like their own childhood schools did, and a need to adopt particular textbooks and take standardized tests. The very structure of such tests, breaking learning into components that are tested in a disjointed manner, discourages integrated learning and reinforces the associationist view. Although teachers in training read constructivist accounts of learning, they are placed in a system that is designed for associative learning. Furthermore, many progressive schools were not successful owing to a lack of discipline, too extreme a follow-the-child approach, and a failure to teach basic facts and procedures. I think that Montessori does not come up short when it comes to learning facts, because the curriculum has a backbone of core materials that teach a core set of facts.

research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p5,"Creative performance, involving novel behavior that meets a standard of quality or utility (e_g,, Guilford, 1968; Maltzman, 1960; Shalley, 1991; Wallach & Kogan, 1965; Winston & Baker, 1985), is conducive to success in various endeavors. For example, developing the habit of approaching academic tasks innovatively helps students to become self-directed, active learners (Torrance, 1965). The continual application of creative thought to new problems contributes to notable scientists' multiple discoveries, as illustrated by the careers of Einstein, Feynman, von Neumann, and Szilard (Clark, 1972; Gleick, 1992; Lanouette, 1992; Macrae, 1992). And an innovative approach to the daily mix of unforeseen business problems and opportunities enables employees to contribute more substantially to the success of organizations (George & Brief, 1992).
  Divergent thinking, an important component of creative performance, involves the production of varied responses to a problem or a question that has multiple alternative solutions (Guilford, I 968; Runco, I 991; Winston & Baker, 1985). According to general behavior theory, divergent thinking, as any discriminable response class, should be enhanced by systematic reward (cf. Maltzman, 1960; Pryor, Haag, & O'Reilly, I 969; Skinner, 1953; Torrance, 1970; Winston & Baker, 1985). Consistent with this view, a review of20 behaviorally oriented studies concluded there was compelling evidence that reward effectively enhances divergent thought (Winston & Baker, 1985). For example, when Goetz and Baer (1973) gave preschool children verbal approval for each new pattern they created with a set of blocks, novel patterns were continually produced. When approval was next made contingent on repetition",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,5

research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p7,"of previously constructed patterns, novelty decreased, only to be restored when new patterns were again rewarded. When Glover and Gary (1976) asked fourth- and fifth-grade students to suggest a variety of uses for common items, and used a token economy to reward the children for doing so, the novelty of stated uses increased.
  The development of a generalized orientation toward divergent thinking has been regarded by behaviorists as an important possible consequence of rewarding such behavior. In a series of studies, Maltzman (1960) gave college students repeated presentations of a list of words and instructed the students to give a free association to each stimulus word. The students received verbal approval for generating a new word every time they received a repeated presentation of a stimulus word. This procedure increased the subsequent originality of uses that the students gave for common physical objects. Funderbunk (1977) reported that giving children verbal approval for constructing novel drawings similarly increased the originality of uses the children later gave for common objects. Glover (1980) found that the originality of written essays produced by college students was increased by preliminary training in which the students received points toward their course grade for generating multiple solutions to everyday life problems and for supplying unusual uses for common objects. As with other response classes, the generalized effects of reward for divergent thought have been found to increase with the similarity between the training task and the transfer task (Goetz, 1982, 1989).
On the basis of behavior-analytic approaches and expectancy
theories, and empirical evidence such as that reported above, the use of rewards to promote creativity has been advocated for business (e.g., Edwards, 1989; Farr & Ford, 1990) and education (e.g., Funderbunk, 1977; Goetz, 1989). The strongly held view by many researchers and practitioners that reward is a useful tool for increasing creativity in applied settings is illustrated by Torrance's comment that he had seen ""excitingly original thinking when the conditions had rewarded such achievement"" (Torrance, I965, p. I 3 I) and by Davis' recommendation that ""a creative atmosphere rewards creativity and helps it become habitual"" (Davis, I 986, p. 208).",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,7

research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p9,"In contrast to the seemingly well-established incremental effects of reward on divergent thinking, considerable evidence gathered by cognitively oriented researchers suggests precisely the opposite conclusion, that reward inhibits divergent thinking. For example, Krug]anski, Friedman, and Zeevi (1971) required college students to list possible titles for a paragraph. The titles produced by students promised reward were judged to be less creative than titles given by unrewarded students. Loveland and Olley (1979) found that the promise of reward for completing a drawing task reduced the diversity of forms incorporated into the drawings. Amabile, Hennessey, & Grossman (1986) reversed the usual temporal order of instrumental behavior and reward by allowing school children the use of a camera to take photographs (the reward) on condition that the students agree to subsequently construct collages and stories. The creativity of the collages and stories was inferior, as rated by judges, to that of other children engaged in the same activities without the stated contingency.
  Cognitively oriented researchers, as behaviorists, have argued that reward in one task has generalized effects on the performance of subsequent tasks, but with the difference that reward is predicted to reduce creativity. Reward in one task would create a generalized reward expectancy that would inhibit creative performance in later tasks (Hennessey & Amabile, 1988). Amabile and her colleagues gave preadolescent children a painting task followed by a collage-construction task. Half the children received a positive evaluation of their painting performance before they began the collages, and half the children received no evaluation. The positive evaluation for painting was intended to establish an expectancy of evaluation during subsequent collage construction and to thereby reduce the creativity of the collages. As predicted, the children rewarded for painting subsequently produced collages judged to be less creative (Hennessey & Amabile, 1988).
Many textbooks and literature reviews in the fields of animal
learning, social psychology, business, and education have concluded, on the basis of the cognitively oriented studies, that reward has an inherent debilitating effect on human creativity. For example, an extensively cited review published in this journal stated that individuals who are provided rewards ""seem to work harder and produce more activity, but the activity is of a lower quality, contains more errors, and is more stereotyped and less creative than the work of comparable nonrewarded subjects working on the same problems"" (Condry, 1977, pp. 470-471). The use of rewards to promote generalized creativity is not possible, we are informed by another investigator, because ""reinforcement seems ineffective at producing anything but stereotyped repetition of what works"" (Schwartz, 1982, p. 57). A primer on practical techniques for enhancing student's creativity warns of serious decremental consequences of reward (Tegano, Moran, & Sawyers, 1991).
  A thoughtful eclectic researcher, reviewer, or practitioner might be excused for expressing bewilderment at the differing conclusions reached by behaviorists and cognitively oriented investigators. Most empirical studies report strong effects of reward on creativity, but the direction of effects seems to vary for no well-understood reason other than the behavioral-versuscognitive conceptual framework of the researchers. Each group",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,9
research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p10,"of researchers seldom comments on the other's findings except to point out methodological.deficiencies. The present research investigates why behaviorists and cognitively oriented investigators have come to opposite conclusions concerning the effects of reward on creativity by (a) addressing the concerns raised both by the behaviorally oriented investigators and the cognitively oriented investigators concerning the others' methodology, (b) elaborating the processes suggested by the two groups of investigators, and (c) evaluating the possibility that the effects of reward on divergent thinking result from a combination of processes suggested by the two groups. We begin with methodological issues.
  Simply asking individuals to concentrate on generating multiple possible solutions enhances performance on divergentthinking tasks (e.g., Torrance, 1988). Because the great majority of behavioral studies of divergent thinking have been concerned with developing practical, effective training procedures, researchers have often included spoken directions or descriptive comments that explicitly inform the participants of the desirability of creative performance (cf. Goetz, 1989). The acknowledged cost of this strategy is the inability to separate the effects of reward from instructions (Winston & Baker, 1985).
  Thus, one explanation of the differing findings of the behavioral and cognitive studies, suggested by Amabile (1983, p. 127), is that the incremental effects reported by the behaviorists are due to instructions rather than reward. More generally, the incentive value of reward is usefully distinguished not only from the effects of explicit instructions and informative comments, but also from implicit information about required performance conveyed by the reward contingency itself(Zimmerman, 1985). That is, the contingency between performance and reward informs individuals about appropriate behavior in addition to supplying an incentive for carrying out the behavior. In the behavioral studies, the participants may have increased their divergent thinking simply because of the informational properties of the reward contingency. The present research examines the incentive effects of reward on generalized divergent thinking while controlling for these informational factors.
  Because the cognitively oriented investigators hypothesized that the decremental effects of reward on creativity stem from cognitively manipulable reward expectancies, the repeated presentation of a reward contingency is usually omitted in favor of the simple promise of reward, the single pairing of performance with reward, or the provision ofreward before the required performance (cf. Malouf, I 983). Behaviorists have argued that such abbreviated techniques increase the participant's use of implicit, previously learned cues for performance that may evoke behavior different from the actual repeated presentation of a reward contingency. Many of the cognitive experiments might have failed to obtain a positive effect of reward on creativity because of their abbreviated procedures (cf. Dickinson, 1989; Flora, 1990; Malouf, 1983; Reiss & Sushinsky, l975, 1976; Skinner, 1953; Workman & Williams, I 980). Therefore, the present studies incorporate the repeated presentation of contingent reward.
  A few studies by cognitively oriented investigators did repeatedly reward performance and nevertheless obtained decrements of creativity. In most of these studies, the reward could be ob-",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,10
research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p11,"tained with a low degree of divergent thinking. For example, McGraw and McCullers (1979) had college students solve a series of problems in which a specified quantity of water was to be measured out using three jars of differing size. Although the size of the individual jars was varied from problem to problem, as was the total amount of water to be measured out, all the problems could be solved by the same simple rule for combining the contents of the three jars. Unknown to the students, the final problem required the discovery of a new rule. The students who had been promised monetary payment for correct solutions of the problems required more time to solve the new problem than was taken by an unrewarded control group. The results were interpreted to indicate that all use ofreward induces a set for simple cognitive performance.
  However, these and related findings might indicate not that reward inherently reduces generalized creativity, but that rewarding a low degree of divergent thinking produces a reduced generalized orientation toward divergent thought (cf. Reiss & Sushinsky, I 975, 1976). Such an interpretation would be consistent with findings that reward for low cognitive effort reduces the quality of performance in subsequent tasks (Eisenberger, Kaplan, & Singer, 1974; Eisenberger, Leonard, Carlson, & Park, I 979). Note that in studies involving the repeated use of a reward contingency, cognitively oriented investigators generally reward a low degree of divergent thought, whereas behaviorists generally reward a high degree of divergent thought. The present research examines whether reward for high-versus-low degrees of divergent thought have different generalized effects.
  In sum, on the basis of the critiques by the behaviorists and cognitively oriented investigators concerning the others' methodologies, the present research (a) controls for the informational properties of reward contingencies, (b) uses repeated experience with reward-contingent performance, and (c) compares the generalized effects of reward for high-versus-low degrees of divergent thinking.
  We now examine in more detail processes that may underlie the effects of reward on divergent thinking. The willingness to exert high cognitive effort could contribute to individual differences in creative performance (Sternberg & Lubart, 1991). The possible manner in which a generalized orientation toward high or low degrees of divergent thinking develops from reward contingencies can be derived from learned industriousness theory (Eisenberger, 1992). According to this approach, effort is a fundamental response-produced experience, the aversiveness of which is highly sensitive to secondary reward effects. The theory states that if an individual is rewarded for putting a large amount of cognitive or physical effort into a task, the sensation of high effort acquires secondary reward properties, and the aversiveness of high effort is thereby decreased. This reduced aversiveness of high effort should increase the individual's readiness to expend effort in subsequent goal-directed tasks. An individual can also learn that a small amount of effort hasa high payoff. Reward for low effort should contribute to low effort's secondary reward properties while extinguishing some of the previously conditioned secondary reward value of high effort. The result would be to make low effort less unpleasant relative to high effort. The individual would then be Jess willing to expend high effort in subsequent tasks.",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,11
research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p12,"There is considerable evidence that rewarded high effort does produce a generalized increase in industriousness. Increasing the degree ofrequired performance involving one or more tasks raised the subsequent vigor and persistence of various other activities, including rats' lever pressing and runway traversal (Eisenberger, Carlson, & Frank, 1979; Eisenberger, Carlson, Guile, & Shapiro, 1979; Eisenberger & Masterson, 1986), depressed mental patients' card sorting (Eisenberger, Heerdt, Hamdi, Zimet, & Bruckmeir, 1979), learning-disabled and typical preadolescent students' handwriting, drawing, and mathematics performance (Eisenberger & Adornetto, 1986; Eisenberger, Heerdt, et al., 1979; Eisenberger, Mitchell, & Masterson, 1985; Eisenberger, Mitchell, McDermitt, & Masterson, I 984), and college students' manipulatory behavior (Nation, Cooney, & Gartrell, 1979; Pittenger & Pavlik, 1988), perceptual identifications (Eisenberger & Leonard, 1980), essay writing (Eisenberger, Masterson, & McDermitt, 1982; Eisenberger, McDermitt, Masterson, & Over, 1983), anagram solving (Boyagian & Nation, 1981), and resistance to cheating (Eisenberger & Masterson, 1983; Eisenberger & Shank, 1985). Extended effort training produced Jong-term effects with both rats (Eisenberger, Weier, Masterson, & Theis, 1989) and humans (Eisenberger et al., 1984).
  Learned industriousness theory assumes that individuals learn which dimensions of performance are rewarded and generalize high or low effort more to these performance dimensions than to other dimensions in subsequent tasks. Preadolescent learning-disabled students who received points for reading with high accuracy subsequently produced more accurate drawings and stories than did those who had been rewarded for reading with high speed or for the mere completion of the reading task. In comparison, students who were rewarded for high reading speed subsequently constructed stories more quickly than did children who had been rewarded for high reading accuracy or for the mere completion of the reading task (Eisenberger et al., 1984). Such dimensional learning would also apply to creative performance. Reward for a high degree of divergent thought would increase the secondary reward value of divergent thinking, resulting in an increased generalized tendency to think divergently. Reward for a low degree of divergent thought would lessen the secondary reward value of divergent thinking, resulting in a reduced generalized tendency to think divergently.
  A different possible mechanism, suggested by cognitive investigators to explain decremental effects of reward on creativity, centers on reward's attention-eliciting properties. Reward is assumed to orient the individual toward goal-relevant stimuli, thereby ""diverting attention from the task itself and nonobvious aspects of the environment that might be used in achieving a creative solution"" (Amabile, 1983, p. 120; see also Amabile et al., 1986; Balsam & Bondy, 1983; McGraw, 1978; Reiss & Sushinsky, 1975, 1976; Sternberg & Lubart, 1991). This narrowing of attention would reduce the spontaneity and flexibility of performance that results from high task involvement and contributes to creative performance (McGraw, 1978; Sternberg & Lubart, 1991). In support of this view, Amabile and McGraw cited findings that reward lessens the incidental learning of information that appears to the learner to be unrelated to the task",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,12
research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p13,"solution (Bahrick, Fitts, & Rankin, 1952; Johnson & Thomson, 1962, McNamara & Fisch, 1964).
  Although widely accepted as a general explanation of the decremental effects of reward on creativity, the preceding attentionelicitation hypothesis has not yet been used to derive and test distinctive predictions. A central, untested implication of the attention-elicitation hypothesis is that reward should have a greater decremental effect on divergent thinking if presented in a way that attracts increased attention. Increased reward salience, resulting from a greater reward size, proximity, quality, and so forth, would reduce the task attention that contributes to creative thinking and thereby produce a greater reduction in creativity. Salient rewards would create a strong generalized expectancy of future reward, draw attention away from the intrinsic task properties, and thereby reduce creativity in subsequent task performance (cf. Hennessey & Amabile, 1988).
  More generally, it is possible that the seemingly inconsistent effects of reward on divergent thinking result from the combined action of industriousness-learning and attention-elicitation processes. According to this two-factor interpretation, whether reward produced an increase or a decrease in divergent thinking would depend on the combination of the degrees of rewarded divergent thought and reward salience. Rewarding a high degree of divergent thought would have a generalized incremental effect on creativity by increasing the secondary reward value of divergent thinking, whereas rewarding a low degree of divergent thought would have a generalized decremental effect on creativity by extinguishing some of the previously established secondary reward value of divergent thought. Salient rewards would reduce these effects by creating a generalized expectancy oflarge reward that would attract attention away from the task itself. A pair of experiments tested these predictions.",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,13

  Study I examined the effects of the degrees of rewarded divergent thought and reward salience on the development of generalized divergent thought by fifth- and sixth-grade school children. There were six groups of children produced by the factorial combination of two levels of rewarded divergent thought crossed with three levels of reward salience. In the high-divergent-thought condition, the children were asked to construct six new words from letters contained in a target word. In the lowdivergent-thought condition, the children were asked to construct a single new word from the target word. These procedures were repeated with four additional target words, making a total of five training trials.
  The children received one of three magnitudes of monetary reward (zero, I, or I0per trial). To increase the salience of the large monetary reward, the pennies awarded at the end of each trial in the 1and IQconditions were stacked in plain sight next to the participant. To equate across the groups the information concerning appropriate performance, all participants received verbal instructions concerning required task performance and were told ""correct"" each time they fulfilled the reward contingency.
  To assess the generalized effects of the degrees of rewarded divergent thought and reward magnitude, we next presented the",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,14
research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p15,"children with pages that contained printed rows of unfilled circles and asked them to draw pictures using the circles as basic elements in the drawings and to inform the experimenter when they were finished. This task, adapted from the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (Torrance, 1965; Yamamoto, 1964), was selected to allow (a) an extremely broad range of originality in the subject matter of the children's drawings, and (b) the objective measurement of originality based on the infrequency of occurrence of the drawings' subject matter in the population of drawings constructed by the large sample of children (cf. Christensen, Guilford, & Wilson, 1957; Eisenman, 1987; Funderbunk, 1977; Milgram & Rabkin, 1980; Runco, 1986; Wallach
& Kogan, 1965; Ward, 1969).
  According to learned industriousness theory, reward for divergent thinking on the word-construction task should increase the originality of performance on the subsequent circle task, whereas reward for a low degree of divergent thinking should decrease subsequent originality. In contrast, the reward salience hypothesis would predict that the receipt of a large reward on the word-construction task, regardless of the degree of rewarded divergent thinking, would reduce subsequent originality. According to the two-factor interpretation that incorporates both processes, a small reward for a high degree of divergent thought on the word-construction task should increase subsequent originality. A small reward for a low degree of divergent thought should reduce subsequent originality. Both these effects should be reduced by the use of a large reward in the word-construction task.",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,15

  Subjects and materials. Participants were 192 fifth- and sixth-grade students (83 boys and 109 girls) of varied socioeconomic background attending the Bayard elementary school in Wilmington, Delaware. To help ensure that every student would be able to successfully complete the training task, participants were required to have a reading level,
determined by standardized tests, to be no lower than I year behind their current grade level. Participants were given a sheet of 20.3-in. x
27.9-cm blank loose-leaf paper and a pencil so they could work on the training task. The training task required the students to construct new words using any number of the letters contained in the target words shown to them. Children in Grades 3- 7 have been found to be able to carry out this task successfully without extensive instruction (Stevenson, Klein, Hale, & Miller, 1968). The five target words (brontosaurus, desperation, instrument, mechanical, and refrigerator) were selected from a list found by Hillerich (1978) to be generally recognizable and pronounceable by children in the age range of the participants and to have an approximately equivalent length ( I 0-12 letters). All words were printed in capital letters on index cards.
  For the transfer task, all children received sheets of20.3-cm X 27.9- cm paper with 30 circles (five rows X six columns). Each circle had a diameter of 3.8 cm. To make clear to the children the need to incorporate the circles into their drawings, the first circle was filled in to create a simple ""happy face"" (i.e., two dots represented the eyes, one dot represented the mouth, and an arc represented the smile).

To control for possible differences in task difficulty for the five target words, half the students in each group received the reverse order of the target words.

  To decrease the probability of falsely accepting null hypotheses, the following strategy was used in this and the following study: (a) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to reduce error variance in the test data due to individual differences among participants that were extraneous to the purposes of the research (Huitema, 1980; Kirk, 1982), (b) one-tailed statistical tests were used to evaluate directional hypotheses (Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1985; Toothaker, 1993), and (c) any predicted effect that failed to reach a conventional level of statistical significance was replicated, using an independent sample of children, and",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,20
research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p21,"the results of the original study and the replication were combined by meta-analysis (Winer, 1971; Wolf, 1986). Whereas in accord with our research strategy, we report ANCOVAs, it turned out that the major findings of this and the following study were statistically significant even without the use of covariates to reduce error variance.
  To determine the originality of the words that the children constructed in training, each word was assigned a score equal to the total number of times it appeared in the population of words produced by all the participants. The children produced a total of 415 different words. In the high-divergent-thought condition, originality increased from the first to the sixth word per trial, as indicated by a 3 X 6 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on reward condition (zero, 1, or 10) and
Words 1-6. The only significant effect was the increasing originality from the first to the sixth word, F(5, 465) = 16.20, p <
.00 I. The mean frequency scores for the first to the sixth words were as follows: 57.7, 44.7, 40.9, 41.9, 35.3, and 35.0. This increase of originality across the sequence of responses is frequently reported in research on divergent thinking (Christensen et al., 1957; Milgram & Rabkin, 1980; Runco, 1986; Ward, 1969). The result may reflect a tendency to initially produce responses with high associative strength, as elicited by the task, before the individual produces more-novel responses (Christensen et al., 1957). As Wallach (1988, p. 117) put it, ""unusualness seems to ride the back, as it were, of the tendency to produce longer ideational strings.  ""
  The major data of interest concerned the originality of the children's circle drawings. Two judges' examination of the subject matter ofall the children's drawings produced a total of 373 different topics. Examples of frequently used topics were faces and decorative buttons, whereas examples of infrequently used topics were eyeglasses (involving the connection of two adjacent circles) and tires. The judges next tabulated the number of times each topic was represented in the population of drawings. To determine the originality of a given child's drawings, the two judges, working independently, assigned each drawing a score equal to the total number of times the same topic appeared in the population of drawings. In the rare cases in which the two judges disagreed in their assignment of a child's drawing to a particular subject, the judges' scores for that drawing were averaged. Finally, each child's average originality score was obtained by adding the originality scores for all of the child's drawings and dividing by the total number of drawings that the child produced.
  The correlation between the average originality scores given to the children by the two judges was .998. The average frequency of occurrence of each group's drawings in the population of drawings is given in Figure I. Low scores signify use of less frequently used topics and, therefore, greater originality. It was possible for these scores to exceed the number of participants in the study because the scores reflect the number of times a drawing appeared in the total population of drawings. In our analysis of the drawings' originality, we used as covariates the children's gender, grade level, and left-versus-right handedness.

However, the use of a small reward for a high degree of divergent thinking did not produce a statistically reliable generalized increase in creativity. This effect, involving the difference in creativity between the high-divergentthought, small-reward group and the high-divergent-thought, zero-reward group, only approached statistical significance despite the large numerical difference in creativity scores. A replication study comprising the same two conditions was therefore carried out with a somewhat larger group size. Then the results for the two conditions were combined across the studies by meta-analysis.
In the replication study, 80 fifth-grade students (27 boys and

The two-factor interpretation of the effects of reward on generalized creativity predicted that reward for a high degree of divergent thought would have an incremental effect on generalized creativity, that reward for a low degree of divergent thought would have a decremental effect on generalized creativity, and that these effects would be lessened by the use of a large reward. A focused test for the existence of an interaction between the degree of rewarded divergent thought and the amount of reward revealed, as predicted, that the small monetary reward produced the greatest difference in the originality of the drawings between children in the high-divergent-thought condition and the low-divergent-thought condition, t( 183) = 2.97, p < .002. Simple-effects tests were used to break down this interaction. As predicted, a small reward for a low degree of divergent thought produced a decrement in children's generalized creativity. Specifically, among children who received the low-divergentthought task, the Ireward produced less generalized originality than did the zero reward, t(l83) = 2.52, p < .006. The conclusion was less clear concerning the prediction that a small reward for a high degree of divergent thought would produce an increment in generalized creativity. Among children who received the high-divergent-thought task, the Ireward produced considerably greater generalized creativity than the zero reward. However, this difference did not reach a conventional level of statistical significance, t( 183) = I .11, p <. I 5. Finally, in accord with the attention-elicitation hypothesis, the use of a large reward eliminated the difference in creativity found between the groups receiving the high-divergent-thought task and the low
divergent-thought task, t( 183) = .20.

Because the total sample of children in the original study was larger than in the replication study, the frequency counts of drawings in the main study were used to score the originality of students' scores in the replication study.
  The correlation between the average originality ratings assigned by the judges to the children in the replication study was
1.0. As predicted, the high-divergent-thought, small-reward group demonstrated a greater generalized creativity than the high-divergent-thought, zero-reward group. The ANCOVA revealed that the difference between the means of the two groups (178 and 268, respectively) was statistically significant, t(77) = 1.80, p < .05. Moreover, the combination of the results of the original study and the replication study, examined with a conventional meta-analytic technique, produced a statistically reliable difference between the two groups (Winer's combined test [Winer, 1971; Wolf, 1986], Z = 2.05, p < .025).
We previously noted that in divergent-thinking problems, re
sponses occurring later in sequence are usually found to be more original than those that occur earlier. Therefore, the reward for a high degree of divergent thought in the word-construction task might have increased originality during the usual-length response sequence or might have evoked additional drawings of greater originality after the usual-length response. Considering first the main study, a 2 X 3 ANCOVA examined the effects of the two degrees of rewarded divergent thought and the three levels of monetary reward on the number of drawings produced in the circles task. The ANCOVA assumption of homogeneity of the regression slopes was met (all ps > .15). The only reliable result was that a required high degree of divergent thought produced a greater number of subsequent drawings than a required low degree of divergent thought,
F(2, 183) = 5.05, p < .03. Of greater interest was the failure of the degree of required divergent thinking to interact with the conditions of reward, F(2, 183) = .53. Thus, the reward condi
tions affected the originality of the drawings throughout performance and not the number of drawings produced. The replication study suggests a similar conclusion in that the high-divergent-thought, small-reward group produced unreliably fewer drawings than the high-divergent-thought, zero-reward group,

  These results indicate that, depending on the degree of rewarded divergent thought and the salience of reward, reward can increase or decrease generalized creativity. Consistent with two-factor theory, a small reward for a high degree of divergent thought enhanced generalized creativity, and a small reward for a low degree of divergent thought reduced creativity.

research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p30,"In the first study, a large reward for a high degree of divergent thought produced no greater generalized creativity than the same reward for a low degree of divergent thought. One possible conclusion is that generalized effects of reward for high-versuslow degrees of divergent thought can be obtained only with rewards having a small size. However, other research suggests that reward size is only one of a number of parameters that combine to determine the attention-eliciting properties of reward. Mischel (1981) found that conditions designed to increase the anticipation of a preferred reward's consummatory properties reduced how long children were willing to wait before they settled for the Jess-preferred reward. For example, the children spent less time waiting if the preferred reward was physically present (Mischel & Ebbesen, 1970) or if they were asked to form a mental image of the reward's attractive consummatory qualities (e.g., the chewy, sweet, soft taste of marshmallows; Mischel & Baker, 1975). Conversely, children were more willing to wait for a preferred reward when the reward was not physically present or when their attention was directed toward the reward's less appealing qualities or to a symbolic representation of the reward.
  According to the two-factor interpretation, it should be possible to obtain effects ofa large reward on generalized creativity if the attention-eliciting properties of reward size were countered by some other means of altering reward salience. Mischel's research, reviewed above, suggests that the physical proximity of reward is salient for children. Recall that in the first study, the monetary rewards were piled next to the participants. It follows from the two-factor interpretation that reducing the salience of the large reward by eliminating its close physical presence should make it possible to obtain generalized effects of rewarding different degrees of divergent thought. In the present study, we examined whether generalized effects of a large monetary reward for high-versus-low degrees of divergent thought could be established by placing the reward out of the children's sight. Out of view, the large reward should elicit less attention and therefore be more likely to produce effects similar to those obtained in the prior study with a small reward. All children in the second study received the same monetary reward that was used in the large-reward condition of the prior study (10per trial).

All children were shown the monetary reward on each training trial, and depending on the condition, the money was either accumulated on the table to the side of the training materials or was accumulated in a cup out of the child's view.

  The correlation between the average originality scores given the children by the two judges was 1.0. The norms for word frequencies in training and for drawing frequencies in test, developed in the first study, were used to evaluate originality in the second study. Similar to the training results of the first study, in the high-divergent-thought condition, originality increased from the first to the sixth word per trial, as indicated by a 2 X 6 repeated measures ANOVA on reward location (proximal vs. distal) and Words 1-6. As in the first study, the only significant effect was the increasing originality from the first to the sixth
word, F(5, 570) = 43.7, p < .001. The mean frequency scores for the first to the sixth word were as follows: 67.3, 52.7, 46.6, 43.9, 35.0, and 33.6.
  The major data of interest concerned the originality of the children's drawings. The average frequency of occurrence of each group's drawings in the total population of drawings is given in Figure 2. The ANCOVA assumption of homogeneity of the regression slopes was readily met (p > .20). The 2 X 2 ANCOVA examined the effects of the degree ofrewarded divergent thought (low vs. high) and the reward location (proximal vs. distal) on generalized originality. A focused test was carried out on the possible interaction between the degree of rewarded divergent thought and the proximity of the reward. As predicted, the physical absence of the reward produced the greater difference in the originality of the drawings between children in the high-divergent-thought condition and the Iow-divergentthought condition, t(226) = 1.74, p < .05. Simple-effects tests indicated that, among children receiving the large, distal reward, requiring a high degree of divergent thought produced greater average generalized creativity than requiring a low degree of divergent thought, t(226) = 2.52, p < .0 I. As in the first study, among children receiving the large, proximal reward, the difference in average creativity resulting from a high-versus-low degree of required divergent thought did not approach statisti

  The increase ofgeneralized creativity produced by reward for a high degree of divergent thought supports behavior theory's assumption that performance in any discriminable response class, including divergent thought, can be effectively strengthened by reward (Maltzman, 1960; Pryor et al., 1969; Skinner, 1953; Torrance, 1970; Winston & Baker, 1985).

  In both the first and the second study, the use ofa large, proximal reward eliminated the generalized effects of rewarding different degrees of divergent thought.

research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p39,"General Discussion
  The present findings increase our understanding of why behaviorists and cognitively oriented investigators have come to opposite conclusions about reward's effects on creativity. The results suggest that reward influences creativity through the combined effects of two processes involving learned industriousness and directed attention. A monetary reward for a high degree of divergent thought in one task (word construction) in-",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,39
research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p40,"involved the incentive properties of the reward. The results are also consistent with cognitive approaches that emphasize the importance of task-focused motivation for producing creative performance (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Sternberg & Lubart, 1991).
In divergent-thinking tasks, the responses occurring later in
sequence are generally found to be more original than those occurring earlier (Christensen et al., 1957; Milgram & Rabkin, 1980; Runco, 1986; Ward, 1969). Therefore, reward for a high degree of divergent thought could either increase originality during the usual-length response sequence or add additional responses of increased originality after the usual-length sequence. Both kinds of effects would be assumed to be influenced by motivation and effort (Runco, 1986; Ward, 1969) and would contradict suggestions that reward generally increases an individual's amount of activity at a cost to overall flexibility and creativity (Condry, 1977, pp. 470-47 I).
  In the present studies, reward for a high degree of divergent thinking influenced the average originality of generalized performance without having a measurable effect on the frequency ofresponding. Thus, repeated reward for divergent thought increased originality during the usual-length response sequence rather than adding responses of increased originality after the sequence. These findings follow from learned industriousness theory (Eisenberger, 1992), according to which individuals learn the dimensions of performance that are rewarded and generalize high or low performance more to those dimensions than to others. To the extent that individuals discriminate that reward depends on the originality of their performance rather than the frequency ofresponses, reward should influence originality during the usual-length response sequence. The results are consistent with prior findings indicating that rewarded high speed or accuracy in one task generalized more to the same dimension of performance in subsequent tasks than to the alternative dimension (Eisenberger et al., 1984).
  The decrease of generalized creativity, obtained by rewarding a low degree of divergent thought, is similar to previous findings that reward for low cognitive effort reduces the quality of performance in subsequent tasks (Eisenberger et al., 1974; Eisenberger, Leonard, Carlson, & Park, 1979). As suggested by Reiss and Sushinsky (1975, 1976), providing reward for a low degree of creativity may produce a type of""learned laziness"" that lessens creative performance. According to learned industriousness theory, rewarding a low level of effort in a given performance",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,40
research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p41,"dimension increases the secondary reward value oflow effort in that dimension and extinguishes some of the secondary reward of high effort. Thus, reward for a low degree of divergent thought would increase the unpleasantness of divergent thinking in subsequent tasks.
  The generalized decremental effect of rewarding a low degree of divergent thought is consistent with related results in cognitively oriented studies (e.g., McGraw & McCullers, 1979; Schwartz, 1982). The conclusion drawn by those researchers, that reward has an inherent decremental effect on generalized creative performance, is supplemented by the present findings concerning the degree of rewarded divergent thought. Depending on whether a high degree or low degree of divergent thought is rewarded, generalized creativity will increase or decrease.
  The elimination of the generalized effects of different degrees of rewarded divergent thought that resulted from increasing the size and proximity of reward follows from the attention-elicitation hypothesis (Amabile, 1983; Amabile et al., 1986; McGraw, 1978; Reiss & Sushinsky, 1975, I 976; Sternberg & Lubart, 1991), as incorporated into the present two-factor interpretation. Salient reward would attract attention away from the task and thereby interfere with the learning of high or low generalized divergent thought. Furthermore, salient rewards would create a strong generalized expectancy of future rewards and thereby draw attention, during subsequent tasks, to the reward itself(cf. Hennessey & Amabile, 1988). The reduced attention to the intrinsic properties of the tasks would reduce the flexibility and spontaneity of performance (McGraw, 1978; Sternberg & Lubart, 1991).
  We found that the combination of two different features of reward salience, large size and high proximity, were required to eliminate the generalized effects of industriousness training. Neither of these features alone was sufficient to fully counteract the reward contingency. The results indicate that no single aspect of a reward's salience prevents its effective use as a motivator of creative performance. Rather, it is the summation of a reward's attention-inducing properties, in combination with the degree of rewarded divergent thought, that determine whether a reward will enhance or interfere with the development of divergent thought.
  The present findings suggest that disagreements concerning whether reward increases or decreases creativity might usefully be replaced by further investigation of the conditions that maximize such increases or decreases. The use of a large, proximal reward eliminated the generalized effects of rewarding a high degree of divergent thought but did not reduce generalized creativity to a level less than that of the unrewarded control condition. This suggests that the decremental effect of high reward salience roughly balanced the incremental effect of a high level of rewarded divergent thought. The two-factor interpretation indicates conditions under which the decremental effect of reward salience might outweigh the incremental effect ofrewarding a high level of divergent thought.
  If the reward were made even more salient than the large, proximal monetary reward used in the present study, individuals' attention to the task and their discrimination of the requirement of high divergent thought might be more effectively inhibited. Mischel's (1981) findings on self-control suggest that an-",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,41
research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p42,"ticipation of the consummatory properties of potent rewards, such as favored snacks and action-filled video games, may generate considerable anticipatory excitement that could more fully dominate attention and interfere more effectively with children's attention to creative tasks. Asking children to think about possible purchases with a proffered monetary reward might similarly draw attention away from the task and reduce creativity (cf. Balsam & Bondy, 1983).
  Future progress in understanding the incremental and decremental effects of reward on creativity requires addressing the methodological critiques by the behaviorists and cognitively oriented investigators concerning the other group's research. We previously noted that the contingency between performance and reward informs individuals about appropriate behavior in addition to supplying an incentive for carrying out the behavior (Zimmerman, 1985). Therefore, unless one controls for the informational properties of the reward contingency, it is difficult to distinguish these informational effects from the incentive effects of reward.
  For many behaviorally oriented studies concerned with developing practical, effective training procedures, the confounding of the informational and incentive features of reward contingencies is a useful strategy (cf. Winston & Baker, 1985). However, when one is concerned with teasing apart the incentive and attentional effects of reward on creativity, the control of informational effects is important. One useful technique for eliminating this confound, used in the present studies, involves supplying all participants with feedback concerning the correctness of their performance. This baseline of information for all participants allows evaluation of the incentive and attention-inducing properties of reward.
  Another basic methodological issue concerns the use of instructions as a substitute for repeated presentation of a reward contingency. Such procedures provide valuable information concerning verbally induced expectancies (e.g., Kruglanski et al., 1971; Loveland & Olley, I 979). However, the results of instructions cannot be assumed to necessarily mimic the effects of repeated presentation of a reward contingency (Dickinson, 1989; Flora, 1990; Malouf, 1983; Reiss & Sushinsky, 1975,
1976; Skinner, 1953; Workman & Williams, 1980). Only by careful attention to these methodological issues can a meaningful dialogue be established between behaviorists and cognitive investigators concerning the effects ofreward on creativity.
  How creativity is affected by other features ofreward contingencies, besides the required degree of divergent thought and reward salience, needs to be investigated with the kinds of methodological controls previously discussed. It has been argued that highly creative people tend to strongly value their intrinsic interests and their independence and that they may respond to extrinsic rewards rebelliously by reducing the quality and creativity of their performance (Barron, 1963; Eisenman, I 99I). More generally, because Western culture inculcates the value of individualism and self-expression, overbearing attempts to restrict alternative courses of action, such as the accompaniment of reward by implied threats of punishment for noncompliance, may produce psychological reactance and a lessening of the quality of performance (cf. Deci & Ryan, 1985; Hennessey & Amabile, 1988; Skinner, 1953).",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,42
research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt_p43,"However, it is also the case in everyday life that the recipients of rewards deemed socially appropriate and deserved usually report feeling encouraged and valued. For example, most students whose parents provided them with financial support for their college education interpreted such support as an indication of love and caring (Brinberg & Castell, 1982). Also, perceived organizational support has been found to increase employee innovation (Eisenberger, Fasolo, & Davis-LaMastro, 1990). The withholding of rewards that the individual believes are deserved and appropriate, rather than their provision, may be more likely to be perceived as coercive.
  The present findings have practical implications for the classroom. High reward salience appears to counter the effects of reward for divergent thought (cf. Amabile, 1983; Amabile et al., 1986; Balsam & Bondy, 1983; McGraw, 1978; Reiss & Sushinsky, 1975, 1976; Sternberg & Lubart, 1991). The teacher who continually draws attention to valued rewards faces the possibility of undermining creative performance (Tegano et al., 199 I). Furthermore, the present research and previous findings (e.g., McGraw & McCullers, 1979; Schwartz, 1982) suggest that providing rewards for a low level of divergent thought reduces generalized creativity. To meet pressures by students, parents, and administrators, many teachers award verbal approval and high grades for low-quality performance on tasks that could be used to promote creativity (Eisenberger, 1989). The present results support suggestions that allowing self-indulgent task performance, with little consideration of performance quality or skill enhancement, hasdecremental effects on creativity (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Sternberg & Lubart, 1991).
On the other hand, contrary to the conclusion of many re
views, texts, and primers that reward inherently reduces creativity, the judicious reward of divergent thought seems to promote generalized creativity (cf. Funderbunk, 1977; Goetz, 1989). In the present studies, the combination of both the reward's large size and close proximity was required to eliminate the incremental effect of rewarded divergent thought. Reward training would appear to have incremental effects on generalized creativity when (a) a high degree of divergent thought is required, and (b) the reward is presented in not too salient a fashion. Procedures that draw children's attention to the less-appealing qualities of consumable rewards or to rewards' symbolic representation (Mischel, 1981), or that use small amounts of money or tokens that must be accumulated to obtain desirable rewards (Chance, 1993), show continued promise as effective motivators of creative performance.",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Creativity,research-paper_rewards-and-creativity.txt,43

research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p5,"A substantial body of research shows that praise, rewards, and punitive consequences (e.g., verbal reprimand, time-out, taking away privileges) are effective in managing individual student behavior and thus are common techniques of classroom manage- ment and school discipline (Bear, 2015; Landrum & Kauffman, 2006). Indeed, in addition to other techniques, such as devel- oping supportive teacher-student relationships and students' social and emotional competencies, the most effective teachers and schools use praise and rewards to teach and reinforce desired behavior and use punitive consequences to decrease undesired behavior (Bear, 2015; Brophy, 1983, 1996; Landrum & Kauffman, 2006). Despite their effectiveness in managing student behavior, praise, rewards, and punitive consequences have been subjects of much criticism, with the harshest criticism voiced against the use of punitive consequences and particularly corporal punishment and",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,5

Frequent praise and rewards also have been the targets of criticism (Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 1999, 2001; Dweck, 1999, 2006; Kohn, 1999). Although a comprehensive review of the research on praise, re- wards, and punitive consequences and the criticisms of their use is beyond the scope of the current study, one criticism is primarily addressed: That an emphasis on the frequent use of teacher- centered praise, rewards, and punitive consequences promotes students' extrinsic motivation but sti?es their intrinsic motivation for prosocial behavior.1",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,6

research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p12,"(Eisenberg et al., 2006; Solomon, Battistich, Watson, Schaps, & Lewis, 2000). Compared to students who are primarily motivated extrinsically, those who are primarily motivated intrinsically are better adjusted socially, emotionally, and academically (Battistich, 2008; Blunt-Bugental & Grusec, 2006; Deci & Ryan, 2008a, 2008b; Eisenberg et al., 2006; Frieberg, 1999; Zsolnai, 2002).
   Concerns about the frequent use of external praise and rewards (especially the latter) promoting extrinsic motivation and sti?ing intrinsic motivation for prosocial behavior have been voiced by researchers of the past (e.g., Kohlberg, 1984; Montessori, 1974; Piaget, 1932/1965) and present (Adelman & Taylor, 2010; Osher, Bear, Sprague, & Doyle, 2010; Deci et al., 1999, 2001; Dweck, 1999, 2006; Reeve, 2009, 2015). Those researchers are likely to agree that an approach to classroom management and school discipline that emphasizes teachers' frequent use of praise and rewards is more favorable than an approach that emphasizes pu- nitive consequences. However, they often point out that the pri- mary aim of both approaches is too often one and the same e obtaining student compliance to adults' rules and behavioral ex- pectations. It is argued that at the expense of focusing on this short- term aim, the long-term aim of developing social-emotional skills associated with self-discipline and intrinsic motivation is too often overlooked. This criticism applies to two of the most popular ap- proaches to school discipline (Osher et al., 2010): the zero-tolerance approach, with its emphasis on punitive consequences and particularly removal from the classroom or school to manage stu- dent behavior, and the behaviorally-oriented School-Wide Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS) approach, with its emphasis on frequent and systematic use of praise and rewards for teaching and managing student behavior (Sugai & Horner, 2009; Sugai et al., 2010).
Moral development theory and self-determination theory, two
prominent theories in developmental psychology, are often cited when criticizing the use of systematic and frequent external re- wards and punitive consequences to manage student behavior (Bear, 2010; Osher et al., 2010; Brophy, 2004). We discuss these two theories brie?y below.",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,12
research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p13,"1.1.1. Moral development theory
   Moral development theory posits that moral reasoning, or the way in which individuals think about moral situations, advances through cognitive maturation, social experiences, and the inter- nalization of societal values (Eisenberg et al., 2006; Kohlberg, 1984). Over the course of development, children and adolescents gradu- ally identify, integrate, and internalize external social and moral knowledge into their own value system and use those values to guide their reasoning and to self-regulate their behavior (Grolnick, Deci, & Ryan, 1997). In the early elementary grades, children's behavior is motivated primarily by seeking rewards or attention and by avoiding punitive consequences. Moral reasoning becomes more sophisticated over time, taking into account the perspectives and needs of others both individually and collectively (Eisenberg et al., 2006; Kohlberg, 1984). Whereas self-oriented moral reasoning tends to be representative of students who display",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,13
research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p14,"associated with differences in one's perceptions of self- determination or control over one's own decision making, behavior, and environment. This process is best described as a continuum from low internalization and high extrinsic (also referred to as controlled) motivation or reasons for engaging in moral and social behavior to high internalization and high intrinsic motivation.2 Along the continuum there are four types of motiva- tional reasoning that re?ect four degrees of internalization and self- regulation. The ?rst two degrees re?ect extrinsic motivation, with individuals engaging in prosocial behavior to gain rewards and avoid punitive consequences. The third and fourth degrees of internalization re?ect reasoning that is intrinsically or autono- mously regulated. Individuals engage in prosocial behavior due to personal concern for others and for moral values. Self- determination theory posits that as individuals increase the strength to which they possess intrinsic prosocial motivation, they decrease the strength to which they possess extrinsic prosocial motivation.
   Research indicates that prosocial reasoning associated with the degrees of internalization in self-determination theory aligns with the development of more mature types of moral reasoning (Ryan & Connell, 1989; Wentzel, Filisetti, & Looney, 2007). That is, prosocial reasoning associated with the ?rst two degrees of internalization in self-determination theory is quite similar to early types of moral reasoning in that both are self-oriented and focused on external contingencies (e.g., seeking rewards and avoiding punitive conse- quences). The latter two degrees of internalization in self- determination theory are also quite similar to the more mature types of moral reasoning in that they are other-oriented and based largely on perceptions of empathy, the impact of one's behavior on others, caring, principles of fairness and justice, and an under- standing and appreciation of rules and laws. Similar to research linking moral reasoning to prosocial and antisocial behavior, research guided by self-determination theory shows that students with high intrinsic motivation, compared to those with high extrinsic motivation, demonstrate greater prosocial behavior and less antisocial behavior (Roth & Bibi, 2010; Ryan & Connell, 1989). From the perspectives of moral development and self- determination theories, an emphasis on teacher-centered tech- niques for managing student behavior, especially punitive conse- quences and the systematic use of external rewards, is likely to harm intrinsic motivation and promote extrinsic motivation. This is because such an emphasis undermines students' internal sense of responsibility and self-regulation, leading students to attribute the cause of their behavior to the salience of external praise, rewards, and punitive consequences, and not to self-perceptions of compe- tence and autonomy (Blunt-Bugental & Grusec, 2006; Eisenberg
et al., 2006; Weiner, 2006).",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,14

   In theorizing how intrinsic prosocial motivation develops and is maintained, Deci and Ryan (2008a, 2008b) argue that external moral and social values become internalized through an incre- mental process. The degree to which knowledge is internalized is",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,19
research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p20,"2 To be clear, the term intrinsic prosocial motivation as used in this study does not entirely represent the nature of intrinsic motivation in Deci and Ryan's self- determination theory. Self-determination theory conceptualizes intrinsic motiva- tion as an inherent enjoyment in the engagement in an activity that is not the result of the internalization process. Whereas prosocial motivation develops through the internalization process (i.e., individuals identify and recognize the value of acting prosocially), it is not inherently intrinsic in nature (Ryan & Connell, 1989). However, the term intrinsic prosocial motivation was used in this study to describe the two highest internalized forms of prosocial motivation (i.e., identi?ed and integrated) as it is commonly used in the literature when discussing the controlling use of re- wards (e.g., Adelman & Taylor, 2010; Brophy, 2004; Frieberg, 1999; Solomon et al., 2000).",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,20
research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p21,"theories, several comprehensive reviews of the literature have concluded that tangible rewards can be harmful to intrinsic moti- vation. This is particularly true when rewards are used in a con- trolling manner to elicit compliance (e.g., ""If you behave, you will earn a ticket"") and when social comparisons are highlighted (e.g., ""You're earning more tickets than Harry"") (Deci & Ryan, 2008a; Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 2001, 1999). Although praise also has been found to impact intrinsic motivation negatively (Dweck, 1999), it is less likely to do so compared to tangible rewards because praise is rarely used in a controlling manner (Deci et al., 1999, 2001). Nevertheless, praise often is the subject of the same criticism of tangible rewards (e.g., Dweck, 1999, 2006; Frieberg, 1999; Kohn, 1999).
   Other reviews of the research literature, however, have concluded that it is very unlikely that rewards, especially as commonly used in schools, harm intrinsic motivation (Akin-Little, Eckert, Lovett, & Little, 2004; Cameron & Pierce, 1994; Cameron, 2001). In those reviews researchers concluded that intrinsic moti- vation, as observed in increases in desired behaviors and decreases in undesired behaviors, almost always improves with use of external rewards. The researchers recognize, however, that rewards are not always effective (i.e., do not always reinforce behavior) and might harm intrinsic motivation under certain controlling condi- tions. They also often advise against frequently rewarding students for behavior that they already exhibit in the absence of external rewards. However, they assert that although those contexts and practices are often found in research laboratoriesdwhich is where most of the studies cited in the above reviews were con- ducteddthey are seldom found in classrooms and schools (an assertion challenged by opposing researchers). Thus, advocates of the frequent and systematic use of praise and rewards (e.g., Akin- Little et al., 2004; Cameron, 2001; Sugai & Horner, 2009) largely dismiss the practical importance of studies that have reported harmful effects.",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,21

research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p23,"Despite the debate and concerns among researchers and edu- cators, there is a dearth of school-based studies examining whether praise, rewards, and punitive consequences, as commonly used in schools, are associated with intrinsic and extrinsic prosocial moti- vation. This was the focus of the current study. As described in the section that follows, we conducted the study in schools that to one extent or another adopted the SWPBIS approach for prevention and school discipline, in which the frequent and systematic use of praise and tangible rewards is a primary feature (Bear, 2010; Sugai et al., 2010). However, as also described, many of those schools also used punitive consequences, especially suspension. Thus, we ex- pected great variability in the frequency of the use of praise, re- wards, and punitive consequences in those schools, thereby providing a valuable context to test if greater frequency of their general use is associated with students' extrinsic and intrinsic prosocial motivation. In examining relations between students' intrinsic and extrinsic prosocial motivation and their perceptions of the frequency of their schools' use of praise, rewards, and punitive consequences, we controlled statistically for the effects of sex and race/ethnicity at the individual student level and for socioeconomic status at the school level.
   Based on literature previously described, we predicted that greater extrinsic prosocial motivation would be associated with students' perceptions of more frequent use of praise, rewards, and punitive consequences. We also predicted that students' percep- tions of the more frequent use of punitive consequences would be associated with less intrinsic prosocial motivation.

research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p27,"At the time of the study, the 58 schools attended by students in the sample were currently implementing the Delaware Positive Behavior Support (DE-PBS) approach, which integrates strategies and techniques of the SWPBIS approach (Sugai & Horner, 2009; Sugai et al., 2010) with those of the Social and Emotional Learning approach (SEL; Durlak, Domitrovich, Weissberg, & Gullotta, 2015). Such integration is not uncommon (Bear, Whitcomb, Elias, & Blank, 2015; Bradshaw, Mitchell, & Leaf, 2010). To one extent or another each school had been integrating these two approaches for at least one school year, with the number of years of implementation ranging from 1 (n 1/4 3) to 7 (n 1/4 5) and a
mean of 4 years. Consistent with the SWPBIS approach (Bear, 2010),
schools were encouraged to recognize desired behavior of students with praise and tangible rewards, including tokens or tickets that were exchangeable for tangible rewards and privileges.
   Although all schools used praise and rewards at the school-wide level, we expected much variation would exist within and across schools in their actual use. This was especially true given that the schools likely varied in their philosophies, trainings, and imple- mentation of practices. Moreover, to one extent or another, all schools had participated in state-wide workshops provided by the Delaware Department of Education (DDOE) in the SEL approach, and they were encouraged to integrate features of SWPBIS, including tangible rewards, with techniques more commonly associated with the SEL approach. The SEL techniques included targeting not only observable behaviors but also developing ?ve basic SEL skills commonly cited in the SEL literature (Durlak et al., 2015): responsible decision making, self-management of emo- tions and behavior, relationship skills, self awareness, and social awareness. Instead of emphasizing the frequent and systematic use of rewards (except when needed for behavior not intrinsically motivated), greater emphasis is placed on the importance of sup- portive teacher-student relationships, use of curriculum lessons to develop SEL skills, and opportunities for students to apply SEL skills.
   Additionally, practices consistent with a zero tolerance approach to school discipline, with its emphasis on use of school suspensions as a consequence for misbehavior, was clearly in place in many of the schools. As required by state law, all schools had codes of conduct that delineated a graduated severity of conse- quences for misbehavior, including suspension from school. During the school year that data were collected in the current study, Delaware had recently been ranked ?fth in the United States for the number of out-of-school suspensions (Of?ce for Civil Rights, 2010). Although the extent to which each school implemented SWPBIS, SEL, and zero tolerance practices was not evaluated, the combina- tion of those practices in the schools served the purposes of the study quite well in providing a setting in which schools engaged not only in the frequent use of praise and rewards but also punitive consequences.",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,27

Those two scales are described below.,,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,32
research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p33,"2.3.1. Positive and punitive disciplinary techniques
   Eight items on the 2013 version of School Disciplinary Tech- niques scale of the DSCS-S assessed students' perceptions of the use of positive and punitive disciplinary techniques by teachers and other adults within their classrooms and school. Four items comprised a positive techniques subscale that assessed the use of praise and rewards. Those items were: ""Students are praised often,"" ""Students are often given rewards for being good,"" ""Teachers let students know when they are being good,"" and ""Classes get re- wards for good behavior."" Four items comprised a punitive disci- plinary techniques subscale: ""In this school students are punished a lot,"" ""Students are often sent out of class for breaking rules,"" ""Stu- dents are often yelled at by adults,"" and ""Many students are sent to the of?ce for breaking rules."" Prefacing each item, students were asked ""how much do you think the following happens in this school."" They responded using a 4-point Likert scale, with 1 1/4 Disagree a Lot, 2 1/4 Disagree, 3 1/4 Agree, and 4 1/4 Agree a Lot.
Within each subscale, scores across the four items were added
together to create a composite subscale score.
   Evidence of the validity and reliability of subscale scores are presented in a technical manual for the DSCS-S produced by the DDOE (Bear et al., 2014). Included are results of con?rmatory factor analyses con?rming the factorial integrity of the two subscales and showing invariance across grade level (i.e., elementary, middle, and",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,33

research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p35,"2.3.2. Intrinsic and extrinsic prosocial motivation
   A 24-item Prosocial Motivation Scale was developed to assess students' perceptions of their motivation or reasoning towards two prosocial situations: (a) helping others and (b) following rules. Students were ?rst given the question ""Why do you help others?"" followed by a set of 12 reasons that might govern their thinking (e.g., ""Because teachers praise me for being good""). Next, students were asked ""Why do you follow school rules that are fair?"" and were again given a set of 12 reasons for doing so. The 12 reasons re?ected operationalized examples of intrinsic prosocial motiva- tion and extrinsic prosocial motivation based on theory and pre- existing prosocial motivation scales (Ryan & Connell, 1989; Wentzel et al., 2007). The scale was designed to measure the prosocial motivation types separately because research has indicated that individuals can possess aspects of both prosocial motivational ori- entations at the same time and at different degrees (Deci & Ryan, 2008b). As also true with all items on the DSCS-S, items had a readability index at the third-grade level. Students responded using a 4-point Likert scale, with 1 1/4 Never a Reason, 2 1/4 Sometimes a
Reason, 3 1/4 Often a Reason, and 4 1/4 Always a Reason. Following
procedures used by Wentzel et al. (2007) for a similar measure of prosocial reasoning, we summed scores on items across the two situations to yield a total intrinsic prosocial motivation score and a total extrinsic prosocial motivation score. We employed explor- atory factor analysis (EFA) to identify constructs underlying the prosocial motivation scale followed by con?rmatory factor analyses (CFA) to cross-validate those results.
   For purposes of factor analyses the sample was randomly divided into two subsamples. With a randomly selected subsample of 5180 students, EFA was conducted using PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc., 2011). We followed procedures similar to those used by Wentzel et al. (2007) to address skewness in distribution of item responses. As such, the 12 prosocial items from each of the two prosocial situations (i.e., helping others and following rules) were combined to create one set of 12 prosocial items (e.g., item 1 from the helping others situation combined with item 1 from following rules situation; Cudeck, 2000). Traditional methods of EFA were ?rst applied, with principal axis factor analysis and Promax oblique rotation and the factor solution evaluated against the following ?ve rules: (a) eigenvalues greater than 1.0 (Kaiser, 1960); (b) scree (Cattell, 1966), (c) Glorfeld's (1995) extension of parallel analysis,
(d) minimum average parcels (MAP; Velicer, 1976), and (e) inter- pretability (Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, & Strahan, 1999).",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,35

research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p43,"The initial EFA of the 12 items presented a three-factor solution; however, the third factor only consisted of two items (i.e., Item 2: ""Because I might get into trouble if I don't"" and item 4: ""Because if I didn't, an adult would tell me I should have helped"" or ""Because I don't want to get yelled at for not following rules""). Although a moderate relationship was found between the two items (r 1/4 0.56),
the magnitude did not substantially differ from the relationships
the two items had with the other 10 items in the scale (range of r's 1/4 0.20e.43). In further determining the number of factors to retain, the MAP indicated a two-factor solution; thus, we decided that the two items on the third factor be omitted from a second EFA. Table 2 presents the rotated pattern matrix for the twoefactor
solution. The factors of Intrinsic Prosocial Motivation and Extrinsic Prosocial Motivation aligned with theoretical expectations, with the ?rst factor accounting for the majority of the variance in the scale (51.56% vs. 14.94% for the second factor). The correlation be- tween the two retained rotated factors was 0.63, indicating that the two dimensions were moderately related and shared approxi- mately 40% of common variance.
   Next, we conducted CFA on the second randomly selected sample (N 1/4 5164), using Mplus 6.11 (Muthe?n & Muthe?n, 1998e2015), to validate the two-factor structure that emerged
from results of the EFA. Because students were nested within schools, prior to conducting the CFA we calculated intraclass cor- relations (ICCs) for each of the factor scores to assess the degree to which variability in student responses could be accounted for at the school level. The ICCs at the school level ranged from 6.8% for scores of extrinsic prosocial motivation to 9.3% for scores of intrinsic prosocial motivation. Thus, because student responses were non- independent and a portion of the variance was accounted for at the school level, the following CFA analyses accounted for the nesting of students within schools by centering individual item responses around the school mean (using the centering command in Mplus). The proposed two-factor model ?rst yielded poor to acceptable ?t indices, c2 1/4 1449.337 (34, N 1/4 5067), p < 0.001, Comparative Fit
Index (CFI) 1/4 0.905, Root Mean-Square Error of Approximation
(RMSEA) 1/4 0.091, and Standardized Root Mean-Square Residual (SRMR) 1/4 0.050. To improve model ?t, we examined modi?cation indices in the initial model speci?cation to determine whether any
of the residual variances were strongly correlated and thus could be added to the two-factor model. This was found for items 6 and 8 and items 9 and 10. These strong correlations are theoretically supported because these two sets of items were designed to gather very similar information. For example, items 6 and 8 were designed to measure reasoning related to gaining rewards and praise and",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,43

HLM accounted for the nested nature of students within schools. As such, in modeling the effect of scores for positive and punitive disciplinary techniques on prosocial motivation, variability within individual student reports (Level 1) was distin- guished and variability between schools (Level 2) with estimate coef?cients of the effects was determined at both levels.
   At Level 1, we covaried statistically for the effects of sex and race/ethnicity. This was done in light of theory and research indi- cating mean differences in the type of prosocial motivation be- tween males and females (Eisenberg et al., 2006; Wentzel et al., 2007) and in classroom removals and school suspensions be- tween African-American and Anglo-American students (American Psychological Association Zero Tolerance Task Force, 2008; Skiba et al., 2011).
   At Level 2, we covaried statistically for the effects of school grade level (elementary, middle, and high school) and socioeconomic status (SES). As a proxy for SES at the school level, the percentage of students in each school that quali?ed for free and reduced meals was used. It was important to covary for grade level effects given research showing age, or grade, differences in prosocial moral reasoning and motivation (Eisenberg et al., 2006; Lepper, Corpus, & Iyengar, 2005). It also was important to covary for SES effects in light of research indicating that middle class and working class/ poor families value and promote self-regulation and compliance with authority differently, thus suggesting they might be exposed to and respond differently to school messages and practices that vary from those present within their familial context (Lareau, 2011).",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,76

We found that students' perceptions of greater use of punitive consequences were associated with slightly less intrinsic prosocial motivation and slightly more extrinsic motivation. This suggests that frequently using punitive conse- quences to manage student behavior may foster extrinsic prosocial motivation and sti?e intrinsic prosocial motivation. However, stu- dents' perceptions of the frequency of praise and rewards was not associated with less intrinsic prosocial motivation. Instead, it was associated with slightly greater intrinsic prosocial motivation. In further support of non-harmful effects of praise and rewards, stu- dents reported they were much more motivated intrinsically than extrinsically. They were more likely to endorse intrinsic reasons than extrinsic reasons for their prosocial behavior. This was shown in signi?cant differences in composite scores on measures of intrinsic and extrinsic prosocial motivation. Examination of re- sponses to individual items on those measures revealed that the two most common reasons for prosocial behavior were intrinsically based, focusing on helping and caring about others. In contrast, the two least common were extrinsically based, focusing on being praised or rewarded for good behavior.
The above ?ndings are in accordance with researchers who have
reviewed the literature and concluded that the common use of praise and rewards in schools fosters prosocial behavior but does not harm intrinsic prosocial motivation (Akin-Little et al., 2004; Cameron & Pierce, 1994; Cameron, 2001). It also is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of the research on effects of incentives on intrinsic motivation at school and work, which concluded that ""incentives and intrinsic motivation are not necessarily antago- nistic and are best considered simultaneously"" (Cerasoli, Nicklin, & Ford, 2014, p. 980).

research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p104,"Below we offer three likely reasons why we found praise and rewards to be associated with greater, not less, intrinsic motivation:
(1) differences in research settings, (2) the manner in which praise and rewards are commonly used in schools, and (3) other factors, particularly teacher-student relationships.
4.2.1. 
Differences in research settings
   It may well be that the conditions that researchers have found to harm intrinsic prosocial motivation in laboratory settings do not often apply in school settings. For example, in most previous studies conducted in laboratory settings, children were presented with ""fun"" activities of high interest e perhaps the types of tasks for which systematic and frequent use of praise and rewards are seldom applied in schools (Cerasoli et al., 2014). Moreover, condi- tions were manipulated to investigate the in?uence of perceived social control on intrinsic motivation. Reviews of such studies (Deci et al., 1999, 2001; Henderlong & Lepper, 2002) concluded that a negative impact on intrinsic prosocial motivation is most likely to occur when rewards are perceived by individuals to be socially controlling and manipulative, similar to the common use of puni- tive consequences. As such, individuals who were verbally rewar- ded in a controlling manner (e.g., ""you should be doing well"") showed decreased intrinsic prosocial motivation compared to in- dividuals who received a verbal reward in an informational manner (e.g., ""you are doing well"") (Ryan, Mims, & Koestner, 1983). This is consistent with the theoretical tenets of moral reasoning and self- determination theories asserting that intrinsic prosocial motivation suffers when students feel compelled to comply with external regulations and when their need for autonomy and competence is not met (Brophy, 2004; Deci & Moller, 2005; Grolnick et al., 1997; Hoffman, 2001).",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,104
research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p105,"4.2.2. The manner in which praise and rewards are commonly used in schools
   We did not examine the manner in which praise and rewards were used and how students perceived them (e.g., controlling or informative). However, we speculate that whereas students likely perceived punitive consequences as being administered in a con- trolling and manipulative manner, this was unlikely with the use of praise and rewards. Deci et al. (1999) argue that presenting rewards when they are expected and are contingent on a child's engage- ment in, completion of, and adequate performance of a task (i.e., controlling manner) is more likely to negatively impact intrinsic prosocial motivation than when delivered simply for participating in a task or presented in an unexpected or surprise manner. Like- wise, they argue that highlighting social comparisons when administering rewards, such as announcing winners of the most tokens or praising students for exhibiting desired behaviors lacking in  their  classmates,  impact  intrinsic  prosocial  motivation",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,105
research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p106,"negatively. Although the extent to which those conditions existed in the current study is unknown, we suspect they were not un- common, as public recognitions are often recommended in the SWPBIS approach that was being implemented in schools in this study (Bear, 2010). Nevertheless, despite their likely common use, it appears that praise and rewards are not associated with less intrinsic prosocial motivation. Clearly, future research is needed to investigate the extent to which, and under what conditions and at what ages, students perceive praise and rewards as controlling in school settings, and if such perceptions impact their intrinsic pro- social motivation.
   We also did not examine the extent to which teachers may have praised and rewarded not only expected behaviors, but also the cognitions and emotions associated with intrinsic prosocial moti- vation, such as empathy and social perspective taking that underlie SEL skills such as responsible decision making and social aware- ness. However, we suspect that many teachers did so, as this was strongly encouraged in SEL-focused statewide trainings on evidence-based practices for the wise and strategic use of praise and rewards. For example, in those trainings teachers were informed that research shows that praising dispositional behavior (e.g., ""You're a caring person"") is more effective than praising observed behavior alone (e.g., ""You helped Mary""; Eisenberg et al., 1996). It may be that many teachers in the study praised and rewarded both, fostering intrinsic and extrinsic prosocial motiva- tion. No attempt however was made in the current study to assess the number of teachers and staff participating in those trainings or if those strategies were actually implemented, as the purpose of the study was not to evaluate the effectiveness of those strategies and trainings or to evaluate an integrated SWPBIS/SEL approach.",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,106
research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p107,"4.2.3. Other factors, particularly teacher-student relationships
   Although this study focused on the use of punitive conse- quences, praise, and rewards in schools, we recognize that many other factors, both in and out of school, in?uence prosocial moti- vation. For example, in light of ample research demonstrating the importance of teacher-student relationships in learning and stu- dent behavior (Hughes, 2012; Sabol & Pianta, 2012), it is likely that the quality of teacher-student relationships impacts intrinsic and extrinsic prosocial motivation, which may include moderating the effects of praise, rewards, and punitive consequences on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Teacher-student relationships might explain different ?ndings in laboratories versus school settings regarding the impact of praise and rewards on motivation. That is, students in our study received praise and rewards from a teacher (or familiar school staff member) with whom they likely had a positive relationship or at least were quite familiar. In laboratory studies, the individual providing the reward is typically unfamiliar to the student. It is likely that receiving praise and rewards within the context of an ongoing supportive teacher-student relationship and especially when the teacher conveys and reinforces over time the value of intrinsic prosocial motivation would not only enhance the effectiveness of praise, rewards, and punitive consequences but also reduce the likelihood of rewards having any harmful impact on intrinsic prosocial motivation.",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,107

4.3.1. 
Not examining other factors in?uencing use of praise and rewards
   As mentioned previously, many factors are directly and indi- rectly associated with prosocial motivation. We examined only the frequency of the use of praise, rewards, and punitive consequences, as perceived by students and assessed at only one point in time. We did not examine the conditions under which those techniques were used, including whether they were used in a controlling or infor- mative manner, if social comparisons were highlighted, if they were used to reinforce prosocial behavior that students already exhibi- ted, or if rewards were administered in a contingent or noncon- tingent manner. In not examining additional factors and speci?c conditions that might in?uence the use of praise, rewards, and punitive consequences, it is unclear what accounts for the per- centage of variance in prosocial motivation not explained at the school level by the frequency of their use.",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,109
research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p110,"4.3.2. The non-longitudinal and non-experimental design of the study
   The research design was cross-sectional and correlational, and not longitudinal or experimental. Thus, causal relationships be- tween prosocial motivation and use of positive and punitive con- sequences could not be examined, nor if effects of those techniques might be cumulative over time. Hence, caution is warranted in concluding that the frequency of use of praise and rewards in schools increases both extrinsic prosocial motivation and intrinsic prosocial motivation or that use of punitive consequences neces- sarily increases extrinsic prosocial motivation and decreases intrinsic prosocial motivation. Although theory and research reviewed earlier suggest that the frequency of use of punitive and positive techniques in?uences prosocial motivation, one may well argue that students' prosocial motivation and behavior in?uence the extent to which educators use those techniques in classrooms and schools. That is, when students are not motivated to act pro- socially and to follow behavioral expectations of adults, punitive consequences are likely to follow. Likewise, when students are poorly motivated, teachers may rely on either greater use of praise and rewards to motivate them, or they may use praise and rewards less frequently because the desired behaviors occur infrequently (and thus praise and rewards is viewed as undeserved).",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,110

   Praise and rewards were treated as one construct and not separately. Treating the two as a single construct was supported by results of con?rmatory factor analyses. However, combining praise and rewards precluded examining if the two had different effects on prosocial motivation. According to several reviews (Cameron & Pierce, 1994; Deci et al., 1999), it is the use of tangible rewards, rather than verbal praise, that is most likely to decrease intrinsic prosocial motivation. This is often explained by the typical unex- pected and non-controlling nature of verbal praise, which contrasts from tangible rewards that are often expected. However, as noted earlier, both praise and rewards are commonly criticized in the literature (Deci et al., 2001, 1999; Kohn, 1999), and there is research indicating negative effects of praise on motivation (Mueller & Dweck, 1998).",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,111

Finally, it is unknown if the use of praise, rewards, and punitive consequences in?uenced student behavior, as this was not assessed. As noted earlier, research has shown that those tech- niques, especially praise and rewards, are generally effective in managing behavior of individual students. However, studies also indicate that praise and rewards are much less effective at the classroom level (Brophy, 1981), and are less effective than other classroom management strategies such as developing social and emotional competencies and teacher-student relationships (Korpershoek, Harms, de Boer, van Kuijk, & Doolaard, 2016).",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,113

research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt_p115,"Praise, rewards, and punitive consequences are widely used by teachers internationally to manage student behavior (Bear, Yang, Mantz, & Harris, 2017). Despite the limitations above, our ?nd- ings indicate that greater use of those techniques is associated with slightly greater extrinsic motivation and that greater use of praise and rewards is associated with slightly greater, and not less, intrinsic motivation. We do not question that praise and rewards, and particularly rewards, can be used in a socially controlling manner and thus harm intrinsic motivation, but it may be that they are not commonly used in this manner in most schools, including those that emphasize their frequent use. Regardless what might account for ?nding a positive relationship between praise/rewards and intrinsic prosocial motivation, results suggest that most schools do not need to worry about the frequent and common use of praise and rewards being associated with less intrinsic prosocial motivationdat least not in the short-term. However, it is unknown if the association is found over time, with negative effects of a steady diet of external rewards accumulating.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that praise and rewards be
used wisely and strategically to promote prosocial motivation and behavior both in the short-and long-term. This would include not only using them in an informative and supporting manner but also in other ways recommended by researchers to enhance their effectiveness in promoting prosocial and autonomous behavior and intrinsic prosocial motivation. For example, praise and rewards should be administered contingently for behavior that is dif?cult or of little interest for a student, while simultaneously recognizing the students' effort and autonomous choice. Administering praise, but especially rewards, in this manner is likely to lessen perceptions of external control (Brophy, 1981; Reeve, 2009, 2015). It also helps support autonomy and an internal locus of control rather than an external desire to obtain a reward or comply with rules (Bandura, Caprara, Barbaranelli, Pastorelli, & Regalia, 2001; Dweck, 1999; McDevitt & Ormond, 2007; Reeve, 2009, 2015; Weiner, 2006). Their use also should highlight social and emotional competencies demonstrated by students, such as sense of responsibility, auton- omy, and control of their emotions and behavior (Brophy, 1981, 2004; Henderlong & Lepper, 2002; Reinke, Lewis-Palmer, & Mar- tin, 2007). Teacher-given praise, and especially rewards, also should be faded as students demonstrate the target behavior or compe- tencies, including intrinsic and extrinsic prosocial motivation. Finally, educators should recognize the multiple functions of praise and rewards beyond that of directly reinforcing desired behavior (Bear, 2010; Brophy, 1981; Solomon et al., 2000). For example, the strategic use of rewards and praise increases the ratio of positive- to-negative interactions that educators have with students and therefore can help to enhance teacher-student relationships (McIntosh, Filter, Bennett, Ryan, & Sugai, 2010). In turn, positive teacher-student relationships enhance the likelihood that students",,Cognitive,Study,full_text_passage,Research Paper_Rewards And Motivation,research-paper_rewards-and-motivation.txt,115
