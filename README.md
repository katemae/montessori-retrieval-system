# Montessori Evidence Retrieval and Analysis System

This project aims to develop an information retrieval and text-mining tool that indexes and analyzes excerpts from research comparing Montessori and Traditional education methods. The tool will allow users to search Montessori-related excerpts by key phrases (for example, "environment,” “self-regulation,” or “material”) and view the most relevant evidences comparing Montessori and Traditional education across domains such as cognitive, behavioral, and academic development.

Educational research on Montessori methods and pedagogy is abundant, but it can be difficult for parents and educators to access and interpret for their own understanding. Much of the evidence exists in academic books, research papers, and studies that aren’t easy to parse through while balancing teaching or parenting.

Educational research on Montessori methods and pedagogy is abundant, but it can be difficult for parents and educators to access and interpret for their own understanding. Much of the evidence exists in academic books, research papers, and studies that aren’t easy to parse through while balancing teaching or parenting. This tool addresses that challenge by centralizing key evidence into one searchable system and presenting it in a digestible format. It aims to help parents, educators, and researchers quickly locate and compare findings that support different educational methodologies, reducing the need to manually read through all the complex research literature to decide what's best for their child(ren).

This system will utilize a dataset of Montessori and Traditional education excerpts that have already been tagged by domain and educational approach. The focus is on contextual retrieval and interpretability, making it easier to see not only which results are relevant, but also how they contrast across educational philosophies. I will vectorize the evidence text using TF-IDF or embedding-based similarity, implement a ranked retrieval function to return top-matching excerpts, and, if time allows, integrate topic clustering or summary generation to highlight broader themes across the corpus.

Effectiveness will be demonstrated through qualitative evaluation of example queries and top-ranked results. If time permits, I plan to compute simple precision and recall metrics to further validate performance.

As a solo project, I will be responsible for all aspects of implementation, testing, and documentation of the system..
