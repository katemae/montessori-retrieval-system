      "In one study illustrating the negative impact of deadlines on task interest, Stanford University undergraduates were given a crossword puzzle–creating game called AdLib (Amabile, DeJong, & Lepper, 1976). Some students were told, either directly or implicitly, that there was a deadline for completing the games, after which their data would be of no use. In fact this deadline could be easily met. Others were told only to work as fast as they could, and yet others were not given any information about working fast or completing by a certain time. All participants actually completed the games in the allotted time, confirming that the deadline was a comfortable one. Interest in the game was measured both by how much time participants spent on it during a later free period and by their answers on a quesionnaire about their interest. Students who had been told to work fast and students with no deadline spent over half of their free time in the subsequent period continuing to play AdLib, whereas students in both deadline conditions spent less than a third of their time playing it. Given free choice, then, those with deadlines were simply not as interested in the game later as those who had played it earlier without deadlines. Responses on the questionnaire also reflected varying degrees of interest, with the deadline group reporting less interest in and enjoyment of AdLib. Merely being led to believe one had a deadline decreased motivation for the task.\n",
